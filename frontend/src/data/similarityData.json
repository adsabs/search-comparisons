  "title": "RESOLVE and ECO: Finding Low-metallicity z 0 Dwarf AGN Candidates Using Optimized Emission-line Diagnostics",
  "abstract": "Existing star-forming vs. active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification schemes using optical emission-line diagnostics mostly fail for low-metallicity and/or highly star-forming galaxies, missing AGN in typical z ~ 0 dwarfs. To recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntex (ECO) surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our photoionization grids show that the [O III]/Hβ versus [S II]/Hα diagram (S II plot) and [O III]/Hβ versus [O I]/Hα diagram (O I plot) are less metallicity sensitive and more successful in identifying dwarf AGN than the popular [O III]/Hβ versus [N II]/Hα diagnostic (N II plot or \"BPT diagram\"). We identify a new category of \"star-forming AGN\" (SF-AGN) classified as star-forming by the N II plot but as AGN by the S II and/or O I plots. Including SF-AGN, we find the z ~ 0 AGN percentage in dwarfs with SELs to be ~3%-16%, far exceeding most previous optical estimates (~1%). The large range in our dwarf AGN percentage reflects differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN percentage to ~0.6%-3.0%. The newly identified SF-AGN are mostly gas-rich dwarfs with halo mass <10^11.5 M ⊙, where highly efficient cosmic gas accretion is expected. Almost all SF-AGN also have low metallicities (Z ≲ 0.4 Z ⊙), demonstrating the advantage of our method.",

      "title": "MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) - I. A new sample of AGNs in dwarf galaxies with spatially-resolved spectroscopy",
      "abstract": "The finding of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies has important implications for galaxy evolution and supermassive black hole formation models. Yet, how AGNs in dwarf galaxies form is still debated, in part due to scant demographics. We use the MaNGA survey, comprising ~10 000 galaxies at z < 0.15, to identify AGN dwarf galaxies using a spaxel-by-spaxel classification in three spatially-resolved emission-line diagnostic diagrams (the [N II]-, [S II]-, and [O I]-BPT) and the WHAN diagram. This yields a sample of 664 AGN dwarf galaxies, the largest to date, and an AGN fraction of $\\sim 20~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ that is significantly larger than that of single-fibre-spectroscopy studies (i.e. $\\sim 1~{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$). This can be explained by the lower bolometric luminosity (<10^42 erg s^-1) and accretion rate (sub-Eddington) of the MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies. We additionally identify 1176 SF-AGNs (classified as star-forming in the [N II]-BPT but as AGNs in the [S II]- and [O I]-BPT), 122 Composite, and 173 LINER sources. The offset between the optical centre of the galaxy and the median position of the AGN spaxels is more than 3 arcsec for ~62% of the AGNs, suggesting that some could be off-nuclear. We also identify seven new broad-line AGNs with log M_BH = 5.0-5.9 M_⊙. Our results show how integral-field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for uncovering faint and low-accretion AGNs and better constraining the demographics of AGNs in dwarf galaxies.",

      "title": "Tripling the Census of Dwarf AGN Candidates Using DESI Early Data",
      "abstract": "Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGNs in 75,928/296,261 (≈25.6%) high-mass (<inline-formula> </inline-formula> 9.5) and 2444/114,496 (≈2.1%) dwarf (<inline-formula> </inline-formula> 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4181 sources exhibit a broad Hα component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGNs and doubles the number of intermediate-mass black hole (M_BH ≤ 10^6M_⊙) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 <inline-formula> </inline-formula> 12) and redshift (0.001 <z < 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies (≈2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower-luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the M_BH–M_∗ scaling relation down to <inline-formula> </inline-formula> 8.5 and <inline-formula> </inline-formula> 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.",

      "title": "Crossing the Line: Active Galactic Nuclei in the Star-forming Region of the BPT Diagram",
      "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the reliability of the BPT diagram for excluding galaxies that host an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We determine the prevalence of X-ray AGNs in the star-forming region of the BPT diagram and discuss the reasons behind this apparent misclassification, focusing primarily on relatively massive ({log}({M}_* )≳ 10) galaxies. X-ray AGNs are selected from deep XMM observations using a new method that results in greater samples with a wider range of X-ray luminosities, complete to {log}({L}_{X})> 41 for z < 0.3. Taking X-ray detectability into account, we find that the average fraction of X-ray AGNs in the BPT star-forming branch is 2%, suggesting the BPT diagram can provide a reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection is itself rather incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram, the X-ray AGN fraction is only 14%, which may have implications for studies that exclude AGNs based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN fractions are similar for Seyfert and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs being true AGNs. We find that neither the star formation dilution nor the hidden broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification of X-ray AGNs. On the other hand, ∼40% of all X-ray AGNs have weak emission lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all and often have low specific SFRs. Therefore, the most likely explanation for \"misclassified\" X-ray AGNs is that they have intrinsically weak AGN lines, and are only placeable on the BPT diagram when they tend to have high specific SFRs.",

      "abstract": "We investigated AGN activity in low-mass galaxies, an important regime that can shed light on to black hole (BH) formation and evolution, and their interaction with their host galaxies. We identified 336 AGN candidates from a parent sample of ∼48 000 nearby low-mass galaxies (M_* ≤ 10^9.5 M_⊙, z < 0.1) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We selected the AGN using the classical BPT diagram, a similar optical emission line diagnostic based on the He II λ4686 line, and mid-IR colour cuts. Different criteria select host galaxies with different physical properties such as stellar mass and optical colour and only 3 out of 336 sources fulfil all three criteria. This could be in part due to selection biases. The resulting AGN fraction of ∼0.7 per cent is at least one order of magnitude below the one estimated for more massive galaxies. At optical wavelengths, the He II-based AGN selection appears to be more sensitive to AGN hosted in star-forming galaxies than the classical BPT diagram, at least in the low-mass regime. The archival X-ray and radio data available for some of the AGN candidates seem to confirm their AGN nature, but follow-up observations are needed to confirm the AGN nature of the rest of the sample, especially in the case of mid-IR selection. Our sample will be important for future follow-up studies aiming to understand the relation between BHs and host galaxies in the low-mass regime.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the lowest-mass quiescent galaxies known to exist in isolated environments ({M}^* ={10}^9.0-9.5 {M}_{⊙ }; 1.5 Mpc from a more massive galaxy). This population may represent the lowest stellar mass galaxies in which internal feedback quenches galaxy-wide star formation. We present a Keck/Echelle Spectrograph and Imager long-slit spectroscopy for 27 isolated galaxies in this regime (20 quiescent galaxies and 7 star-forming galaxies). We measure emission line strengths as a function of radius and place galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. Remarkably, 16 of 20 quiescent galaxies in our sample host central active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like line ratios. Only five of these quiescent galaxies were identified as AGN-like in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey due to a lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that many of the quiescent galaxies in our sample have spatially extended emission across the non-star-forming regions of BPT-space. While quenched galaxies in denser environments in this mass range often show no evidence for AGN activity, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies in isolation host AGNs despite their overall passive appearances.",

      "abstract": "We present a sample of 151 dwarf galaxies (10^8.5 <~ M _sstarf <~ 10^9.5 M _⊙) that exhibit optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting massive black holes (BHs), increasing the number of known active galaxies in this stellar-mass range by more than an order of magnitude. Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and stellar masses from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, we have systematically searched for active BHs in ~25,000 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the Magellanic Clouds and redshifts z < 0.055. Using the narrow-line [O III]/Hβ versus [N II]/Hα diagnostic diagram, we find photoionization signatures of BH accretion in 136 galaxies, a small fraction of which also exhibit broad Hα emission. For these broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 10^5 <~ M _BH <~ 10^6 M _⊙ and a median of M _BH ~ 2 × 10^5 M _⊙. We also detect broad Hα in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. The majority of the dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures are characterized by low stellar mass concentrations, blue optical colors, high specific star formation rates, and low stellar metallicities. In contrast, the small number of AGNs found in galaxies with older stellar populations tend to have higher stellar mass concentrations, higher stellar metallicities, and are much more likely to be classified as either Seyfert or composite based on their narrow emission-line ratios. We use this distinction to suggest that there are multiple formation pathways for massive BHs in dwarf galaxies. We discuss our results in terms of the origin of these massive BHs and the demographics of local BH seed relics.",
