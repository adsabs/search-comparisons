      "abstract": "A new model of katabatic winds is presented. A hydraulic approach is employed in which the detailed vertical structure of the flow is replaced by a quiescent stably stratified environment and an equivalent flowing layer which is subject to sustained layer cooling, surface stress and interfacial entrainment. A scaling which contains most of the parametric behavior is found. It shows that interfacial entrainment is the dominating retardation mechanism of the flow and that surface stress may be relatively unimportant.Steady solutions are presented to show that katabatic winds are essentially supercritical on all practical slopes (slope angles &gt;0.1°), and are affected by ambient stratification only at large distances. The model is in satisfactory quantitative agreement with the limited field data available.",

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds are a common feature of the lower Antarctic atmosphere. Although these drainage flows are quite shallow, there is increasing evidence that the low-level circulations are an important component in establishing large-scale tropospheric motions in the high southern latitudes. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime and attendant tropospheric circulations have been conducted over the entire continent to depict the topographically forced drainage patterns in the near-surface layer of the atmosphere. Results of the simulation enable a mapping of katabatic wind potential and identification of coastal regions which may experience anomalously intense katabatic winds. A large upper-level cyclonic circulation forms rapidly in response to the evolving katabatic wind structure in the lower atmosphere, suggesting that the drainage circulations are an important component in prescribing the resulting resulting circumpolar vortex. These results imply that some representation of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime is necessary in general circulation models in order to properly simulate the large-scale circulations about the continent.",

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds dramatically affect the climate of the McMurdo dry valleys, Antarctica. Winter wind events can increase local air temperatures by 30°C. The frequency of katabatic winds largely controls winter (June to August) temperatures, increasing 1°C per 1% increase in katabatic frequency, and it overwhelms the effect of topographic elevation (lapse rate). Summer katabatic winds are important, but their influence on summer temperature is less. The spatial distribution of katabatic winds varies significantly. Winter events increase by 14% for every 10 km up valley toward the ice sheet, and summer events increase by 3%. The spatial distribution of katabatic frequency seems to be partly controlled by inversions. The relatively slow propagation speed of a katabatic front compared to its wind speed suggests a highly turbulent flow. The apparent wind skip (down-valley stations can be affected before up-valley ones) may be caused by flow deflection in the complex topography and by flow over inversions, which eventually break down. A strong return flow occurs at down-valley stations prior to onset of the katabatic winds and after they dissipate. Although the onset and termination of the katabatic winds are typically abrupt, elevated air temperatures remain for days afterward. We estimate that current frequencies of katabatic winds increase annual average temperatures by 0.7° to 2.2°C, depending on location. Seasonally, they increase (decrease) winter average temperatures (relative humidity) by 0.8° to 4.2° (-1.8 to -8.5%) and summer temperatures by 0.1° to 0.4°C (-0.9% to -4.1%). Long-term changes of dry valley air temperatures cannot be understood without knowledge of changes in katabatic winds.",

      "abstract": "The Terra Nova Bay polynya is a perennial winter feature in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica, which occupies roughly 1000 km<SUP>2</SUP>, it is formed and maintained by the combined influence of persistent katabatic winds, which advect newly formed bay ice eastward, and the Drygalski Ice Tongue, which prevents northward drifting pack ice from entering Terra Nova Bay. Existence of anomalously strong katabatic drainage along this coast is predicted by Parish's (1982) simulation of wintertime airflow which reveals a pronounced confluence of surface winds upslope from the Reeves Glacier where the winds are further focused by local topography. The simulation is strongly supported by regional sastrugi orientations. Average wintertime atmospheric conditions and ice sheet topography which control surface air drainage are stable on a climatic time scale; therefore, persistent wintertime katabatic winds should be an annual phenomenon. Further evidence comes from multi-year Landsat images which consistently show windswept, snowfree areas on the Reeves Glacier. In marked contrast to typical Antarctic katabatic winds, strong persistent winter winds are observed at sea level ∼25 km beyond the coastal slope break. Air probably descends as bora-type winds and is likely to be significantly denser than the air at sea level; conditions are not favorable for hydraulic jumps apparently typical of other katabatic regimes. The horizontal density difference is maintained during airflow across the Nansen Ice Sheet because relatively little air mass modification occurs there in contrast to situations where air moves over an ice-laden ocean. Observations thus suggest that katabatic winds maintain their identity for some distance seaward of the coast; qualitative trajectory calculations indicate that for representative geostrophic conditions this distance is on the order of the observed polynya width. Estimated ice freezing rates are ∼20 cm day<SUP>-1</SUP>, but wind-generated waves and currents prevent ice from consolidating. The blocking effect of the Drygalski Ice Tongue is a consequence of its orientation with regard to western Ross Sea ice drift patterns; ice tongue length controls polynya width. Absence of such blocking along other coasts experiencing strong katabatic outflow partly explains why similar polynyas do not form there.",

      "abstract": "Prominent warm signatures of strong, negatively buoyant, katabatic airstreams are present at thermal infrared wavelengths as a result of intense vertical mixing and drift-snow transport within stable boundary layers. These tracers are used to illustrate several aspects of the behavior of katabatic winds in the Ross Sea sector of the Antarctic. The satellite features are compared with surface-based observations whenever possible. Converging surface-wind signatures upslope from Terra Nova Bay are shown to closely follow the observed time-averaged streamlines of drainage airflow. The satellite-observed core of the katabatic airstream descends to sea level via a direct route, but complex three-dimensional trajectories are manifested in marginal regions. Katabatic winds propagating horizontally for hundreds of kilometers over the southwestern Ross Sea do not exhibit the expected influence of the Coriolis force. Katabatic signatures are shown to be climatological features over the Ross Ice Shelf which closely follow surface wind measurements. An approximate proportionality appears to exist between average signature size over the shelf and the magnitude of katabatic mass transport from the plateau.",

      "abstract": "Results of a case study of katabatic winds utilizing tethered balloon profiling equipment are presented and discussed. The data are unique in the detail they provide of both vector wind and potential virtual temperature throughout the flow. It is concluded from the data that the one-dimensional models so far proposed in the literature are inappropriate. Direct computation shows that the divergence of radiation responsible for cooling the air is much smaller than the surface radiation flux used in these models. The inadequacy of these models is not due to the underlying assumption of temporal invariance, but rather the implication is that the flow is significantly three dimensional. Use of surface stress as the retarding stress in the dynamical balance is also shown to be erroneous, at least so long as ambient wind does not assist the katabatic flow. The stress between the flow and the ambient air is much more important and this stress is inextricably tied in with the downslope development of the flow which is thus inferred to play a major part in the dynamics of katabatic winds. Katabatic flow is an example of an internal mixing process. The data are shown to suggest a critical gradient Richardson number of about 1/4 for the maintenance of internal mixing above slope flows.",

We simulate the low-level atmospheric circulation using the numerical weather model MM5 with a triply nested-grid technique. The model simulation reproduces the finger-like katabatic wind pattern at the SAR imaging time. Katabatic wind is strongest in the morning when the surface temperature gradient between ocean and land reaches a maximum. The sea surface wind simulated by the MM5 model and that derived from the calibrated SAR normalized radar cross section are in good agreement.

      "abstract": "The general issue of katabatic wind-driven exchange in fjords is considered using an idealized numerical model, theory, and observations. Two regimes are identified. For fjords narrower than a viscous boundary layer width, the exchange is limited by a balance between wind and friction in lateral boundary layers. For the nonlinear viscous parameterization used here, this boundary layer thickness depends on the properties of the fjord, such as stratification and length, as well as on the wind stress and numerical parameters such as grid spacing and an empirical constant. For wider fjords typical of east Greenland, the balance is primarily between wind, the along-fjord pressure gradient, and acceleration, in general agreement with previous two-layer nonrotating theories. It is expected that O(10%) of the surface layer will be flushed out of the fjord by a single wind event. Application of the idealized model to a typical katabatic wind event produces outflowing velocities that are in general agreement with observations in Sermilik Fjord, a large glacial fjord in southeast Greenland. The presence of a sill has only a minor influence on the exchange until the sill penetrates over most of the lower layer thickness, in which cases the exchange is reduced. It is concluded that the multiple katabatic wind events per winter that are experienced by the fjords along east Greenland represent an important mechanism of exchange between the fjord and shelf, with implications for the renewal of warm, salty waters at depth and for the export of glacial freshwater in the upper layer.",

Significant thermodynamic and dynamic differences are seen between the gravity-driven flows over the gently-sloping interior and over the steep ice slopes near the coast. The strongest temperature inversions and largest static stabilities are found over the interior of the continent, although the net cooling of the katabatic layer and magnitude of the downslope-directed horizontal pressure gradient force are greatest at the coast. The interior is characterized by low Rossby number, quasi-geostrophic type flows, while more intense, near-antitriptic winds occur at the coast.

      "abstract": "The aircraft-based experiment KABEG'97 (Katabatic wind and boundary-layer front experiment around Greenland) was performed in April/May 1997. During the experiment, surface stations were installed at five positions on the ice sheet and in the tundra near Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland. A total of nine katabatic wind flights were performed during quite different synoptic situations and surface conditions, and low-level jets with wind speeds up to 25m s<SUP>-1</SUP> were measured under strong synoptic forcing of the katabatic wind system. The KABEG data represent a unique data set for the investigation of katabatic winds. For the first time, high-resolution and accurate aircraft measurements can be used to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the katabatic wind system for a variety of synoptic situations. Surface station data show that a pronounced daily cycle of the near-surface wind is present for almost all days due to the nighttime development of the katabatic wind. In a detailed case study the stably-stratified boundary layer over the ice and the complex boundary-layer structure in the transition zone ice/tundra are investigated. The katabatic wind system is found to extend about 10 km over the tundra area and is associated with strong wind convergence and gravity waves. The investigation of the boundary-layer dynamics using the concept of a two-layer katabatic wind model yields the results that the katabatic flow is always a 'shooting' flow and that the 'pure katabatic' force is the main driving mechanism for the flow regime, although a considerable influence of the large-scale synoptic forcing is found as well.",

      "abstract": "The katabatic wind events observed in the coastal zone of Adélie Land, Antarctica, on 27 November and 3 December 1985 are simulated with a hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model coupled to a snow model. The diurnal cycle of insolation is strong. The main difference in the forcing between the two events is the large-scale wind, which is weak on 27 November and moderate on 3 December. In both cases temperature and wind are characterized by well-marked diurnal cycles. In particular, katabatic winds blow during nighttime and upslope winds during daytime. In both cases the katabatic airstream slows down progressively over the ocean. Consequently, continental air piles up and this generates a pool of cold air responsible for a pressure gradient force opposing the katabatic wind. An amplification of the slowing down results. When, in the morning, insolation increases, the surface inversion weakens but the influence of the cold air pool increases. The katabatic flow starts to decay over the coastal zone and then retreats progressively toward the ice sheet interior. When the large-scale wind is weak, the surface warming is sufficient for generating an additional upslope bouyancy force, and anabatic flow develops over the ice sheet in the afternoon. When the large-scale wind is moderate and downslope, the pilling up of cold air is important and this has a dramatic impact on the flow. A sharp spatial transition is generated between downslope and upslope winds over the ocean. This discontinuity moves toward the ice sheet interior in the morning and is responsible for the sudden cessation of the katabatic flow seen by static observers. The results of the simulations are used in order to refine a simple parameterization of Antarctic katabatic winds.",

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds have been the subject of investigation since about the 1840s. These winds, which flow down the topographic gradient as a result of surface cooling, provide a major transport and dispersion mechanism in mountainous regions and affect the energy exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. Various theories of their structure, evolution, and fundamental dynamics have been proposed. Initial interest in katabatic winds, which was prompted by field observations, has been followed by a long history of observational studies. This article reviews observational work undertaken on small-scale katabatic winds in mid-latitudes, with an emphasis on the historical background, and recent work on the causes of their variation.",

      "abstract": "The Adélie Land coastal section of East Antarctica is known for strong katabatic winds. Although the primary forcing of these persistent drainage flows has been attributed to the radiative cooling of the sloping ice topography, effects of ambient horizontal pressure gradients can play a central role in shaping the Antarctic surface wind regime as well. Oberrvations of the katabatic wind at the near-coastal Adélie Land station D-10 have been sorted into strong and weak wind classes. Concurrent radiosonde ascents at nearby Dumont D'Urville have been used to depict the timeaveraged large scale conditions accompanying the katabatic wind classes. Results suggest that strong katabatic wind cases are associated with low pressure over the coastal margin and easterly upper level motions. Numerical simulations have been conducted to examine the effect of prescribed large scale forcing on the evolution of the katabatic wind. The model runs indicate that the ambient environment plays a key role in the development and intensity of the katabatic wind regime.",

The GCM has a fine vertical resolution of 300 m throughout the middle atmosphere. The simulation was run for a 1-year period. Results from 21-28 June were primarily considered. OGWs are excited by katabatic winds that travel down the surface slopes of the Antarctic ice sheet. A strong eastward katabatic wind blows over the west coast of the Ross Sea at the approach of the synoptic-scale upper tropospheric westerly jets. A quasi-stationary OGW is then excited above the coast and propagates upward into the mesosphere. An OGW appears sporadically during the Antarctic winter and spring. Its amplitude is determined by the strength of the eastward katabatic wind. Dissipation of OGWs within the middle atmosphere results in a localized deceleration of westerly winds, greater than -30 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. This in turn modifies the horizontal circulation in the polar vortex. Strong vertical mixing occurs within the mesosphere and is associated with wave breaking. Large temperature fluctuations associated with the OGWs affect the formation or suppression of polar stratospheric clouds in the lower stratosphere. Katabatic wind excitation is the most powerful source of gravity waves over Antarctica around the time of the winter solstice.",

The radial diffluence displayed by the drainage flows implies that a continental-scale subsidence is present over Antarctica. From mass continuity considerations, a thermally direct meridional circulation must become established. The upper-level convergence above the Antarctic continent acting to feed the katabatic circulation generates cyclonic vorticity in the middle and upper troposphere. Model simulations show that a robust circumpolar circulation becomes established within a time scale of about a week. The adverse horizontal pressure gradients in the upper atmosphere result in a gradual decay of the low-level katabatic circulation. The katabatic wind regime appears to be an important forcing mechanism for the circumpolar vortex about the periphery of the Antarctic continent.",

We show that this dry air leads to significant low-level sublimation of snowfall. We found using unprecedented data collected over 1 year on the coast of Adélie Land and simulations from different atmospheric models that low-level sublimation accounts for a 17% reduction of total snowfall over the continent and up to 35% on the margins of East Antarctica, significantly affecting satellite-based estimations close to the ground.

The atmospheric circulation in the southern middle and polar latitudes associated with this fluctuation of katabatic wind has been deduced by using the NMC gridded 500-mbar zonal wind and geopotential height field. The axisymmetric circulation pattern to Antarctica is noticeable in the anomalous zonal wind and height field. That is, the strong (weak) katabatic wind phase corresponding to the shallower and broadened (deepened and narrowed) tropospheric circumpolar vortex with weaker (stronger) westerlies over the surrounding oceans. These results strongly suggest that the intraseasonal variation of katabatic wind regime over East Antarctica is part of the modulation of planetary flow regime and meridional circulation in the southern middle and high latitudes, i.e., part of the index cycle of the southern hemisphere.",

The model results are intercompared and validated against observational data from automatic weather stations (AWS), global atmospheric analyses and instrumented aircraft observations of individual cases during that period. The NORLAM is able to simulate the synoptic developments and daily cycle of the katabatic wind system realistically. For most of the cases covered by aircraft observations, the model results agree very well with the measured developments and structures of the katabatic wind system in the lowest 400 m. Despite NORLAM's general ability of reproducing the four-dimensional structure of the katabatic wind, problems occur in cases, when the synoptic background is not well captured by the analyses used as initial and boundary conditions for the model runs or where NORLAM fails to correctly predict the synoptic development. The katabatic wind intensity in the stable boundary layer is underestimated by the model in cases when the simulated synoptic forcing is too weak. An additional problem becomes obvious in cases when the model simulates clouds in contrast to the observations or when the simulated clouds are too thick compared to the observed cloud cover. In these cases, the excessive cloud amount prevents development of the katabatic wind in the model.",

      "abstract": "A medium resolution (10-20 km around Antarctica) global ocean/sea-ice model is used to evaluate the impact of katabatic winds on sea-ice and hydrography. A correction is developed to compensate for the drastic underestimation of these katabatic winds in the ERA40 reanalysis. This correction derives from a comparison over 1980-1989 between wind stress in ERA40 and those downscaled from ERA40 by the MAR regional atmospheric model. The representation in MAR of the continental orography surrounding the ocean, like the Transantarctic Mountains, and a specific parameterisation of roughness length in the planetary boundary layer yield a major improvement in the representation of katabatic winds along the coast of Antarctica. Wind stress directions at the first ocean point are remarkably similar in ERA40 and MAR, but MAR wind stress amplitudes are much greater. From this comparison, a scale factor constant in time (i.e. no seasonal variation) but spatially varying (decreasing off-shore over a distance of about 150 km) is created for the meridional and zonal wind stress components and adapted to the wind vector. The correction thus consists of a local amplification of the amplitude of the 6-hourly ERA40 wind vector components at ocean points near the coast. The impact of katabatic wind correction is investigated in 40-year long twin simulations of a global ocean/sea-ice model. The wind stress over polynyas is increased by a factor of 2, and amplitudes of sensible and latent air-sea heat exchanges are increased by 28% and 18%, respectively. Sea-ice thickness and ice-fraction near the coast of Antarctica show a marked decrease. The amplified katabatic winds also increase the extent of coastal polynyas by 24% (i.e. the total polynya area is augmented by 60,000 km <SUP>3</SUP> around Antarctica), and the winter sea-ice production in polynyas is greater by 42%. Outside polynyas, the impact is a reduction of sea-ice production in the Southern Ocean sea-ice pack. Impacts on the ocean circulation are also marked. Katabatic wind amplification strengthens the local overturning in coastal polynyas with a more intense transformation of Antarctic Surface Waters into colder and denser shelf waters (in total over all polynyas around Antarctica, the overturning reaches 4.7 Sv in annual mean, an increase of 1.8 Sv, and peaks to 6 Sv in winter). The modification of shelf water properties and of the zonal surface winds yields an increase of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of the Antarctic Coastal Current.",

Idealized simulations with a three-dimensional mesoscale model are performed to investigate the development of the Antarctic katabatic wind system and its sensitivity to physical boundary conditions, in particular channeling effects and the thermodynamic forcing close to the coastline. The simulated cases represent wintertime cases with complete sea ice coverage and no sea ice, as well as a realistic summertime situation. For the wintertime situations a large impact of the presence of open water on the three-dimensional structure of the wind field close to the coast can be shown, whereas the effects on the katabatic wind over the continent are relatively small. Near-surface wind speeds over the continental slope for the summertime case have strengths comparable to those of the wintertime cases but reveal a distinct daily cycle due to the daily course of the radiation fluxes. The formation of shallow mesoscale circulations is simulated after 2-4 days of simulation in ice-free coastal areas. In these regions, low-level convergence, diabatic heating, and the cold air advection associated with the katabatic flow leads to low-level baroclinicity and cyclonic vorticity production.",

Observations of air currents on hillsides on radiation nights are presented, which show that two winds exist, the \"hilltop\" wind and the katabatic wind. The effect of each on the other in certain localities is described. It is shown that the hilltop wind is able, on the higher part of a slope facing it, to push uphill the air in the first 10 ft. or so above the ground, and at a lower level to neutralise the force of the katabatic wind, producing a calm belt on the slope. Experiments designed to demonstrate the magnitude of air temperature differences caused by differences in the vegetative cover of the soil alone, by differences in altitude alone, and by a third unknown factor, are described. Evidence is presented showing that when a katabatic wind moves down a slope its temperature does not necessarily decrease. It is indicated how the new information may be applied to the problem of preventing frost damage to crops.",

The LES results show that both the maximum katabatic wind speed and its height decrease with increasing slope angle, and vice versa. However, in the Prandtl analytical, i.e. linear classical, solution, only the wind maximum height is affected by the slope angle, not the maximum wind speed. For the given range of slope inclinations, a linear relation between the height and the magnitude of the wind maximum is found in our simulations, which is supported by a limited dataset obtained by other researchers; these results are further discussed. The inability of the analytical Prandtl solution to give the maximum wind-speed dependency on the slope angle is associated with the assumed constancy of (1) the background vertical potential temperature gradient Γ, (2) the eddy diffusivity and (3) the Prandtl number.",

This correction relies on a comparison of the atmospheric surface circulation simulated by the model with the one provided by a regional atmospheric model, and consists of wind stress modifications in the vicinity of the Antarctic coast. Corrections are spatially varying and different for both wind components. The impacts of the correction on the modelled Antarctic sea ice and World Ocean's properties on long timescales are assessed, showing that katabatic winds thin sea ice and strongly enhance its production along the continent. Consequently, the formation rate, salinity and temperature of the Antarctic Bottom Water are increased. This leads to model results in better agreement with observations, especially in the deep ocean where the mean errors in temperature and salinity decrease by 9% and 37%, respectively. Hence, correcting katabatic winds seems to be an appropriate way to improve the representation of sea ice-related surface processes around Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds occur with great frequency over the Adelie Land sector of Antarctica. Data collected by automatic weather stations (AWSs) along a string of stations from the coast of Adelie Land to the high interior plateau show a marked diurnal cycle of the wind and temperature regimes of the lower atmosphere during the short austral summer period. Numerical simulations of the katabatic wind regime have been conducted for a variety of solar forcing and synoptic conditions assuming a clear sky environment. Results suggest that the katabatic wind is a robust feature of the Antarctic boundary layer. Significant disruption of the low-level drainage features occurs only during the midsummer months owing to the solar heating of the ice slopes and from synoptic activity along the Adelie Land coastline. During midsummer, modeled ground temperatures undergo a diurnal cycle with an amplitude of 15°C near the coast, in good agreement with the AWS observations. The katabatic wind decreases considerably during the middle of the day; wind speeds at coastal sites become reduced by more than one half of the early morning values. The numerical simulations depict a rapid summer to winter transition of katabatic wind conditions over the 1-month period from mid-February to mid-March. The surface energy budget becomes negative for the entire 24-hour period after mid-February, corresponding to the rapid onset of the wintertime katabatic wind regime.",

      "abstract": "The influence of katabatic winds on the Antarctic coastal waters is examined by using simple models of the ocean and atmosphere. A katabatic flow model incorporating Coriolis dynamics is solved analytically and another with nonlinear friction is solved numerically to provide wind stress to a two-layer coastal ocean model. The resulting solutions are evidently the first to incorporate Coriolis terms with a thermodynamic equation that includes compressional warming effects. The emphasis in this paper is on delineating the parameters that control the relative adjustment of the katabatic wind into alongshore and offshore components. By including nonlinear friction, it is shown that steeper slopes and weaker stratification tend to direct the wind more toward the ocean. It is further demonstrated that the katabatic forcing supports the strong polar easterlies (winds from the east) along the periphery of the continent and that the offshore extent should be dependent on the atmospheric Rossby deformation radius. The ocean model shows that significant downwelling occurs at the coast, while upwelling is predicted at a distance of the order of the ocean Rossby radius. An alongshore coastal jet from the east is found in the model and is evidently the manifestation of the east wind drift. The upwelling offshore may be a significant aspect of polynya formation and maintenance of the Antarctic divergence zone and contribute to the biological productivity of the region.",

This station is characterized by a so-called \"cold katabatic\" region. The frequency of occurrence of a single wind direction (in this case, east) is higher at Mizuho than at any other station in Antarctica. Because of this and the strong wind, well-developed sastrugi can be seen in the vicinity. The characteristics of the temperature inversion during clear sky conditions in winter were a quasi-isothermal layer from the surface up to 50 m capped by a thermocline of stronger temperature gradient. The maximum wind speed occurred near this height. The height of the top of the boundary layer, where turbulence becomes quite small, can be considered as the height above this thermocline. The d value of the stable boundary layer obtained by using the above height was 0.048-0.19 in the present case. This value is lower than the values obtained on the flat horizontal surface and on a slope of 0.002 m km<SUP>-1</SUP> in the mid-latitudes. Taking the above height as the top of the katabatic wind, the two-layer model including the surface friction can explain the observational results well, better than the inversion wind model. This seems to indicate that the surface stress is important in the development of the katabatic wind at Mizuho but that the interfacial stress at the top of the inversion layer is not important in its development.",

      "abstract": "A two-dimensional mesoscale model was applied to simulate wintertime katabatic winds in the Antarctic coastal region. Simulations were made for a constant slope angle with the slope height varying and for fixed slope heights with the slope angle varying. Thermal wind opposed the katabatic flow near the foot of the slope, but enhanced it over the high plateau. The steeper and higher the slope, the stronger the effect on the plateau. The 2 m potential temperature decreased down the slope toward sea ice, because (1) the katabatic wind resulted in the accumulation of cold near-surface air over the sea ice and the lower parts of the slope, (2) over the flat sea ice zone, the stratification was stronger, and (3) the shallow slope was within the strong surface inversion from over the sea ice. With a slope aspect ratio of 5 m km<SUP>-1</SUP> and a slope height below 1000 m, 2 m temperature (T<SUB>2m</SUB>) decreased down the slope, but for slope heights of 1500 m and more T<SUB>2m</SUB> increased down the slope. Adiabatic warming and, because of the stronger wind, enhanced turbulent mixing of the warmer air from aloft contributed to the warming. For slope angles ranging from 1 to 20 m km<SUP>-1</SUP>, with a small slope height of 500 m, T<SUB>2m</SUB> decreased down the slope but not monotonically, whereas with a slope height of 2000 m, yielding stronger winds and larger adiabatic warming, T<SUB>2m</SUB> increased monotonically down the slope.

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds are one of the outstanding features of the Antarctic boundary layer. Extreme katabatic winds can be found in a number of coastal regions where orographically induced confluence leads to further acceleration of cold air masses descending from the inner parts of the Antarctic continent. On the hemispheric scale they play an important role in maintaining the balance of mass, energy and angular momentum. Automatic weather station data and manned station data of wind speed and direction is used to assess katabatic wind activity. An objective method was developed to construct a katabatic outflow index, named KAI (from German: Katabatischer Abfluss Index). By the means of the KAI identification of katabatic outflow events was performed for 12 different regions around Antarctica. One of the main problems was to distinguish between katabatic forcing and wind regimes of pure synoptic scale origin. This will be discussed regarding the strength of the continental surface inversion. Cyclonic activity is assessed by an objective tracking method. It is investigated in how far the occurrence of regional katabatic outflow events depends on cyclones. It is especially examined in how far cyclones can favour katabatic outflow on the one hand and if cyclonic development can be modified by katabatic outflow on the other hand. Additionally, ECMWF-analysis data is used to construct a continental scale outflow index by means of mass flux. So katabatic wind activity on different spatial and temporal scales is investigated upon its relationship with extratropical and tropical atmospheric circulation variability as described by several Southern Hemisphere circulation indices. For example, it is investigated in how far katabatic wind activity can be related to the polar vortex variability in strength (Antarctic oscillation index) and eccentricity (trans polar index). Finally, process studies are performed for selected katabatic outflow events to gain a better understanding of the involved physical mechanisms that are responsible for the discussed relationships with synoptic and hemispheric circulation variability.",

Measurements were made under the Japanese POLEX program (POLEX—South), 1979-1981, at Mizuho Station (70°42'S, 44°20'), where the katabatic wind was blowing continuously and a strong surface inversion existed. Direct measurements of the downward and upward longwave fluxes were extended through day and night using pyrgeometers (Eppley PIR) with a simple shading ring to cut off heating by direct solar radiation. Longwave radiation fluxes were also calculated using a simple wide band model, and the effect of the surface inversion was examined. The daily average of the downward flux varies greatly between 90 and 240 W/m<SUP>2</SUP>. The large day to day variation is due to clouds. Overcast skies give an increase of about 80 W/m<SUP>2</SUP> in the downward longwave flux in all seasons. The effective emissivity of the atmosphere for clear sky is very small on account of the small amount of column water vapor. The drifting snow near the surface caused by the strong wind increases the downward longwave flux and suppresses the long-wave cooling at the surface. The relation between the strength of the surface inversion and longwave fluxes is examined and approximated by a linear relation. When the surface inversion becomes strong, the net longwave flux decreases.",

In particular, sea surface roughness patterns generated by katabatic winds blowing from 1800 in high mountains through a broad valley at the western coast of Calabria (southern Italy) into the Gulf of Gioia is investigated. The ERS-1 SAR images show that their areal extent and shape vary strongly, depending on the meteorological conditions. The roughness pattern sometimes has the form of a mushroom, an elongated tongue, a broad blob, or a narrow truncated band. For one event (September 8, 1992) we have simulated the wind field at the sea surface by using a nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model and then compared it with the wind field derived from the ERS-1 SAR image by using the C band wind scatterometer model CMOD4. The comparison shows that the atmospheric model reproduces quite well the mushroom-like form of the wind field pattern, while the wind speed is obtained somewhat lower than the one inferred from the SAR image. This study demonstrates that SAR images acquired over coastal waters are well suited to study local wind fields in coastal areas and to test numerical models that describe local wind fields which extend from the coast onto the sea.",

Included in the table is the record of Dumont d'Urville, situated along the same coastal stretch as Cape Denison and Port Martin.

      "abstract": "A high-resolution GCM (ECHAM-3 T106, resolution 1.1° × 1.1°) is found to simulate many characteristic features of the Antarctic climate. The position and depth of the circumpolar storm belt, the semiannual cycle of the midlatitude westerlies, and the temperature and wind field over the higher parts of the ice sheet are well simulated. However, the strength of the westerlies is overestimated, the annual latitudinal shift of the storm belt is suppressed, and the wintertime temperature and wind speed in the coastal areas are underestimated. These errors are caused by the imperfect simulation of the position of the subtropical ridge, the prescribed sea ice characteristics, and the smoothened model topography in the coastal regions. Ice shelves in the model are erroneously treated as sea ice, which leads to a serious overestimation of the wintertime surface temperature in these areas. In spite of these deficiencies, the model results show much improvement over earlier simulations. In a climate run, the model was forced to a new equilibrium state under enhanced greenhouse conditions (IPCC scenario A, doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB>), which enables us to cast a preliminary look at the climate sensitivity of Antarctic katabatic winds. Summertime katabatic winds show a decrease of up to 15% in the lower parts of the ice sheet, as a result of the destruction of the surface inversion by increased absorption of solar radiation (temperature-albedo feedback). On the other hand, wintertime near-surface winds increase by up to 10% owing to a deepening of the circumpolar trough. As a result, the model predicts that the annual mean wind speed remains within 10% of its present value in a doubled CO<SUB>2</SUB> climate, but with an increased amplitude of the annual cycle.",

During these events, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles revealed bulges of warm, salty water directly beneath the ocean surface and extending downwards tens of meters. These profiles reflect latent heat and salt release during unconsolidated frazil ice production, driven by atmospheric heat loss, a process that has rarely if ever been observed outside the laboratory. A simple salt budget suggests these anomalies reflect in situ frazil ice concentration that ranges from 13 to 266×10<SUP>-3</SUP> kg m<SUP>-3</SUP>. Contemporaneous estimates of vertical mixing reveal rapid convection in these unstable density profiles and mixing lifetimes from 7 to 12 min. The individual estimates of ice production from the salt budget reveal the intensity of short-term ice production, up to 110 cm d<SUP>-1</SUP> during the windiest events, and a seasonal average of 29 cm d<SUP>-1</SUP>. We further found that frazil ice production rates covary with wind speed and with location along the upstream-downstream length of the polynya. These measurements reveal that it is possible to indirectly observe and estimate the process of unconsolidated ice production in polynyas by measuring upper-ocean water column profiles. These vigorous ice production rates suggest frazil ice may be an important component in total polynya ice production.",

      "abstract": "Field measurements have been made since 1951 on hundreds of ventifacts abraded by strong, southerly, katabatic winds that blow in winter and summer past Paulatuk, a small western Arctic coastal settlement. Sand is commonly entrained by the strongest winds in winter. The ventifacts, all glacial erratics deposited prior to 12 ka BP, have been gradually rotated by the southerly winds until the long axes of most ventifacts now trend approximately east-west, normal to the katabatic winds. In contrast, pebbles have a slightly preferred north-south orientation, parallel to the katabatic winds. The facets on sandstone and diabase ventifacts are almost planar, but are rounded on granites and hackled on limestones, reflecting the influence of both solution and abrasion. Abrasion is evident on the built structures in Paulatuk, but despite the over 50 years of observation, abrasion of the ventifacts has been virtually undetectable. The extremely slow abrasion rate has been estimated from: observations on two ventifacts from 1951 to 2003; photographic comparisons and observations of 60 ventifacts from 1968 to 2003; optical examination of 14 granite slabs, polished and unpolished, exposed to abrasion from 1967 to 1976; and comparisons of the windward and leeward sides of six large rock caches built with ventifacts probably long before 1900. If the present rates of abrasion are representative of Holocene conditions, ventifact formation has probably taken much of postglacial time. The increase in vegetation cover around many rocks between 1968 and 2003 suggests that the climate has changed in the last three decades.",

      "abstract": "The summer-time atmospheric circulation at the margin of a large ice sheet, with an extended adjacent tundra, is investigated with a two-dimensional atmospheric model. The assumed topography corresponds to the section through west Greenland for which the Greenland Ice Margin Experiment (GIMEX) was performed. With this model, the local sensitivity of the ablation of the ice sheet to changes in the external parameters (which pertain to climate) is explored. The main focus is the sensitivity which is related to atmospheric dynamics. A comparison is made between the results with an exposed tundra and results with a snow-covered tundra. In the latter case, the katabatic wind is strongly reduced close to the ice margin, so that the downward sensible-heat flux for the ablation zone is more than halved. This shows that the influence of the exposed tundra on the energy balance of the ice sheet is important. Increasing the initial air temperatures leads to a stronger katabatic wind. As a consequence, the downward sensible-heat flux at the ablation zone is strongly enhanced. Neglecting the change of the katabatic wind would lead to a much smaller growth of this flux, which shows that the presence of an exposed tundra increases the sensitivity of the energy balance of the ice sheet to climate change. For those runs the large-scale wind is zero, but in the presence of an inland-directed large-scale wind a strong surface wind parallel to the glacier front is found to develop above the ablation zone, by which the sensible-heat flux is increased. The advection of heated air from the tundra to the ice sheet plays a lesser role.",

      "abstract": "Dumont d'Urville on the Antarctic coast is an area well known for the presence of strong katabatic winds. Since the austral summer 1979/80 a US-French joint experiment has been investigating the katabatic wind in this region. In early 1980 three automatic weather stations (AWS) were installed along a trajectory from Dome Charlie to Dumont d'Urville. Measurements from these stations include air pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction at ground level only. To supplement these data with information regarding the vertical structure and the advective changes in the katabatic flow, two airborne missions were undertaken in November 1980 along a route from Dome Charlie (Dome C) to Dumont d'Urville. In this paper measurements from these two flights are reported and comparisons made with theoretical models of katabatic flow. The data suggest that equilibrium katabatic flow was not established during these two flights. Downslope acceleration of the wind was particularly marked on 20 November, and a hydraulic jump was encountered in the vicinity of Dumont d'Urville. Relative humidity along the trajectory decreased as the coast was approached consistent with the rapid rise in adiabatic temperature. Simultaneously the absolute moisture content of the air increased indicative of net moisture influx. One source of the moisture increase is the evaporation of blowing snow especially in the intense wind region of the coastal slope near Dumont d'Urville.",

      "abstract": "The surface wind pattern over the ice sheets of Antarctica is irregular with marked areas of airflow confluence near the coastal margins. Where cold air from a large interior area of the ice sheet converges (a confluence zone), an anomalously large supply of air is available to feed the coastal katabatic winds, which, as a result, are intensified and more persistent. The confluence zone inland of Siple Coast, West Antarctica, differs from its East Antarctic counterparts in that the terrain slopes become gentler rather than steeper as the coast is approached. In addition, synoptic processes exert substantially more impact on the behavior of the surface winds.A month-long field program to study the dynamics of the springtime katabatic wind confluence zone has been carried out near Siple Coast. Two sites, Upstream B (83.5°S, 136.1°W) and South Camp (84.5°S, 134.3°W), were established roughly perpendicular to the downslope direction. The field program involved the use of the ground-based remote sensing equipment (sodar and RASS) along with conventional surface and balloon observations. Previous analyses revealed the cross-sectional structure of the confluence zone as consisting of a more buoyant West Antarctic katabatic airflow overlying a less buoyant katabatic airflow originating from East Antarctica.The force balances inside the confluence zone are here investigated for three situations: mean (all available wind profiles from balloon launches), and two extreme cases (light and strong winds). A linear regression method is used to estimate the mean vertical wind shears and horizontal temperature gradients. The vertical wind shears are used to examine whether or not the airflows are in geostrophic balance. The results are 1) the airflow above the surface at both sites is in geostrophic balance for the three situations; 2) inside the West Antarctic katabatic wind zone, there are three forces in the north-south direction-the restoring pressure gradient force associated with blocking of the katabatic and synoptic winds, the downslope buoyancy force, and the synoptic pressure gradient force associated with the time-averaged low in the South Pacific Ocean; 3) above the West Antarctic katabatic wind layer, the observed easterly wind is due to the synoptic pressure gradient force associated with the low; 4) inside the East Antarctic katabatic wind zone, in addition to the above three forces, there is the downslope buoyancy force associated with the inversion; and 5) large-scale transient synoptic systems strongly influence the downslope wind speed and the boundary layer depth, resulting in the light and strong wind cases.",

      "abstract": "Strong Katabatic winds in Antarctica are responsible for blowing snow and wind-scoured blue ice areas, polynya and sea ice formation, overturning ocean circulation, and local-scale variations in Surface Mass Balance. Katabatic wind patterns are controlled by temperature and pressure gradients and have high diurnal and seasonal variability. In this project, we use data from 11 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) on the Ross Ice Shelf and optimally structured neural networks to quantify the accuracy of near-surface wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is well known that ECMWF temperature, pressure and wind speed values have systematic biases. Our results show that ECMWF Pressure is biased at an average 7.9 2.8 hPa higher than AWS pressure, and ECMWF temperature has seasonal bias which varies by station. For example in the case of Schwerdtfeger AWS station, in the winter months, the ECMWF monthly average temperature is 1-2 °C lower than the AWS monthly average temperature with no overlap between the 99.7% confidence intervals surrounding these means. Using the controlling mechanisms of the Katabatic winds as inputs, optimally structured neural networks are trained and used to fill in the sizeable data gaps in the AWS wind speed measurements. Our results show from 1985 to present the ECMWF wind speed correlates to the AWS wind speed data with r = 0.74. Our trained neural networks used to fill in gaps in AWS wind speed data achieves a correlation of r = 0.69 with ECMWF data. <P />These preliminary results demonstrate that artificial neural networks can be used to predict missing values and reduce biases in large datasets which has implications for regional climate models that use ECMWF as boundary conditions.",

      "abstract": "Wildfires are a major hazard to humans in the southern California Mediterranean ecosystem and improving our understanding and delineation of different fire regimes is critical to mitigating wildfire-related hazards. Recent research has demonstrated that there are two distinct fire regimes in this region based on the presence or absence of katabatic winds (primarily Santa Ana winds) concurrent with the fire. Here, we expand the katabatic wind category to include Sundowner winds along the Santa Barbara front range and analyze the spatial relationships and difference in ignition sources between fires associated with katabatic and non-katabatic wind events from 1948–2017. We found distinct spatial extents for katabatic versus non-katabatic fires, with areas of the higher number of repeat fires generally associated with one fire type or the other. These spatial delineations were consistent with prior analyses of katabatic wind patterns and were also related to the climatology of marine influences across the region. Finally, we contextualize the burn perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire, the largest fire in modern California history, relative to spatial patterns of katabatic and non-katabatic fires. The 2017 Thomas Fire began during the longest Santa Ana event in the last 70 years in an area that has been burned repeatedly by Santa Ana fires. However, the Thomas Fire ultimately burned into a region where there were no prior Santa Ana fires. The spatial delineation of two relatively distinct fire regimes is critical to making management decisions, such as where to locate suppression resources at critical times and where fuel treatments might be most effective. However, the anomalous pattern of the Thomas Fire also points to the potential for changes in anthropogenic and environmental factors to disrupt historical spatial patterns and suggests that spatial patterns of fire regimes are themselves prospective metrics of global change.",

The minimum values of the backscatter coefficient (the ratio of backscattered versus incident power) are always observed in the direction of katabatic winds. A theoretical analysis shows that the backscatter coefficient must be very sensitive to the sastrugi slopes and orientations, which are streamlined features formed on the snow surface in the wind direction [Parish and Bromwich, 1987]. Satellite scatterometers can thus map the characteristics of sastrugis, of importance for the interpretation of microwave measurements above ice sheets; this indirectly provides the intensity and direction of these very persistent and strong winds, which play a important role in the behaviour of the atmosphere and ocean in high southern latitudes.",

Although the loess cover was later washed out by younger transgressions, the northern limit of the conglomerate corresponds to the original offshore extension of the loess deposits. Compilation of offshore and onshore altitudes of the limits of these deposits shows that loess was deposited by low-level wind fields never thicker than 200 m. Mapping surveys show that the present limits of loess are probably close to their original boundaries. The past proximity of the British Ice Sheet, the accumulation of dusty sediments coating north-facing cliffs of Brittany originating in the outwash of the British–Irish Ice Sheet and in the palaeo-rivers of the English Channel, as well as the southeastward orientation of the palaeo-winds deduced from particle size analysis and heavy minerals distribution, suggest that large volumes of loess were transported by strong katabatic winds blowing from the northern ice-covered regions towards Brittany and Normandy. The existence of katabatic winds is also consistent with the drift of ice rafts that transported Icelandic basalts now grounded in Brittany and possibly with the orientation of Homo neandertalensis shelters.",

The numerical code was described and validated in a companion paper (Part 1). Our numerical results are interpreted in the light of analytical Prandtl model, and we find that our vertical profiles of the downslope velocity, buoyancy, and the momentum and buoyancy fluxes exhibit many of the features from the analytical solution. On the other hand, there are also differences between the analytical and numerical results due to the assumptions in the analytical model. One of the assumptions is that the Prandtl number is constant throughout the boundary layer. However, the simulations show that this number varies with height, and also that the Prandtl number increases with increasing gradient Richardson number. The immediate benefit of LES over analytical models is its capability of resolving turbulent motions. In our study of the turbulence kinetic energy budgets, we find that the wind shear is the largest production term, and that it is mainly balanced by turbulence dissipation. Near the wind maximum, where the shear vanishes, the turbulence transport is the only production term.",

A good correlation is found between the difference of downward longwave fluxes measured at two heights and wind speed used as an index of drifting snow. The wind increases the downward flux at a rate of 2 W m-2/m s-2 when wind speed is higher than 13 m/s. Drifting snow suppresses the net longwave cooling at the surface. Direct solar radiation is depleted greatly by the drifting snow; however, the global flux decreases only slightly, compensated by the large increase of the diffuse flux, at a rate of about 1% for each 1 m/s increase in wind speed. At Mizuho Station, the effect on longwave radiation prevails throughout the year. The relation between snow drift content and wind speed is obtained from shortwave optical depth measurements as a function of wind speed. A simple parameterization of radiative properties is given.",

      "abstract": "Terrestrial and Martian atmospheres are both characterised by a large variety of mesoscale meteorological events, occurring at horizontal scales of hundreds of kilometres and below. Available measurements from space exploration and recently developed high-resolution numerical tools have given insights into Martian mesoscale phenomena, as well as similarities and differences with their terrestrial counterparts. The remarkable intensity of Martian mesoscale events compared to terrestrial phenomena mainly results from low density and strong radiative control. This is exemplified in the present paper by discussing two mesoscale phenomena encountered in the lowest atmospheric levels of both planets with notable differences: nighttime katabatic winds (drainage flow down sloping terrains) and daytime boundary layer convection (vertical growth of mixed layer over heated surfaces). While observations of katabatic events are difficult on Earth, except over vast ice sheets, intense clear-cut downslope circulations are expected to be widespread on Mars. Convective motions in the daytime Martian boundary layer are primarily driven by radiative contributions, usually negligible on Earth where sensible heat flux dominates, and exhibit turbulent variances one order of magnitude larger. Martian maximum heat fluxes are not attained close to the surface as on Earth but a few hundreds of metres above, which implies generalised definitions for mixing layer scales such as vertical velocity w<SUB>*</SUB>. Measurements on Mars of winds in uneven topographical areas and of heat fluxes over flat terrains could be useful to assess general principles of mesoscale meteorology applicable to both terrestrial and Martian environments.",

In this study, bright regions on SAR images caused by katabatic winds are found in the west of Hengchun Peninsula where is located in the southern Taiwan. The katabatic winds cause the sea state variations and then the sea surface temperature changes. Relationships between normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as the temperature difference between air and sea in the west of Hengchun Peninsula are investigated to find out the air-sea heat transfer. The results show that 1) the SST decreases when the NRCS increases, that is, the higher wind speed would cause the SST lower; and 2) the gradient of linear relationship between NRCS and SST is related to the temperature difference between air and sea, that is, the higher temperature difference could increase the release of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere.",

In August 2018, eight weather stations, partly with turbulence measurements at two levels, were installed in the middle and lower part of the Hintereisferner valley glacier in Austria, yielding three weeks of data on the near-surface spatial pattern of atmospheric conditions. These data are used to (a) quantify the observed properties of the glacier wind with regard to its spatial variability, persistence, and the synoptic conditions that erode it and (b) assess how well methods to extrapolate near-surface air temperature over glacier surfaces are influenced by the existence of the glacier wind and match the available observations on Hintereisferner. Despite data limitations and uncertainties, results show that the glacier wind persists under most synoptic conditions, and deepens and speeds up downglacier. However, significant disturbances such as cold front passages and rain events can cause erosion of katabatic wind for periods from minutes to days. Representations of near-surface temperature distribution over the glacier using classical lapse rates and the along flow-line modified Greuell-Böhm model showed variable agreement to the measured data, with evidence for dependency on ambient atmospheric conditions. However, interpretations of the performance of temperature extrapolations should be viewed with caution due to the absence of observations in the upper glacier. We consider how these findings can be included in surface energy balance models of future glacier evolution, and conceptually how this aspect of the glacier microclimate, and the wider valley circulation, can be expected to evolve with continued glacier shrinkage.",

Comparison between the main orientation of Neanderthal shelters and the direction of the katabatic winds shows that they were perpendicular to each other. The dominant orientation of the shelters was apparently ruled by these winds. A small-scale study concentrating on the penultimate glaciation shows that in contrast to Brittany and Normandy where loess deposits accumulated on north-facing cliffs, in England the same particles were deposited on the leeside of the hills. The existence of deflation zones, violently swept by Marine Isotope Stage 6 katabatic winds south of the British-Irish ice sheet, was probably at the origin of the restricted number of Neanderthals at that time in England.",

The estimated roughness height (Z<SUB>0</SUB>) varies from 10<SUP>-l</SUP> to 10<SUP>-4</SUP> cm, even under near-neutral conditions. Large shear stress appears in light wind, followed by increased turbulent intensity. In the katabatic wind region of the plateau, Z<SUB>0</SUB> shows symmetric changes with wind direction. The average value of Z<SUB>0</SUB> in the smoothest direction is 0.0004 cm, which is the minimum value previously reported, and it increases to 0.015 cm for 40° rotation of wind direction toward the roughest direction. The directional dependence of Z<SUB>0</SUB> is similar at three stations located nearly 100 km apart. Unlike the results of Jackson and Carroll at the south pole, the smoothest direction deviates 20° from the mean sastrugi axes and agrees with the direction of the prevailing high wind. The 4-m neutral drag coefficient is estimated to be 0.8 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> for the smoothest direction and 1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> for the roughest direction. The effect of snow drift is unimportant.

      "abstract": "The dynamics of Terra Nova Bay (TNB) winter polynya events has been investigated by means of Sea-Ice Concentration (SIC) maps derived from the observations of the passive microwave sensor AMSR-E; these maps are produced by the Institute of Environmental Physics of the University of Bremen and made available on a daily basis through its web site. The formation and persistence of TNB polynya are thought to be due to the combined effect of katabatic winds, advecting eastward the new formed ice, and of the Drygalski Ice Tongue which inhibits northward ice drift into TNB. To measure polynya extents, an image window covering the area of TNB, approximately from 74.5 to 75.5°S and from 163 to 167°E, was extracted from the whole Antarctic SIC data set. This image window, 20 x 20 pixel size, i.e. 125 x 125 km, which almost exactly circumscribes the TNB polynya, is used for the computation of polynya area. On the basis of previous studies, it is assumed that a SIC pixel is \"open water\" when its value goes below 70%; polynya area is then computed by multiplying the number of \"open water\" pixels by the area of one pixel (39.0625 km<SUP>2</SUP>). As katabatic wind, blowing eastward down from the Presley Glacier, is considered the main forcing factor in the opening of the polynya, wind data from AWS Eneide station, located in the vicinity of the Italian Antarctic Base \"Mario Zucchelli Station\" (74.8°S 164.18°E), were retrieved. Eneide station takes measurements of wind speed and direction and air temperature every hour; wind speed and direction were then composed in one single figure defined as effective wind, i.e. the wind component pushing eastward or at 270°. The correlation between effective wind and polynya extents was analyzed by means of the running correlation coefficient function Ri which can reveal the consistency between the forcing factor of the polynya and its opening. Ri function demonstrates that water areas may correlate either positively or negatively with offshore winds. This main result is analyzed and discussed.",

This research integrates new AMS data with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, granulometric analysis, and spectrophotometric measurements to elucidate the influence of abrupt northern katabatic winds that emerged around 22.7 ka. The appearance of katabatic northern winds in the Scandinavian Ice Sheet's southern foreland correlates well with the time when it covered its maximum area. This change of wind was recorded as a rapid phenomenon without any intercardinal wind directions. Significant shifts in wind patterns corresponded with the major climatic events of the LGM and the end of Heinrich Event 2 (H2). The study documents a pronounced correlation between AMS data and granulometric parameters, indicating dynamic responses of loess deposition to changing wind strengths and directions. The results underscore the sensitivity of the region's paleoclimate to global atmospheric patterns and contribute to the broader understanding of Pleistocene climatic dynamics and their impact on sedimentary processes.",

Wind speeds decreased from 35 to 18 ms<SUP>−1</SUP>, while the wind direction decreased 18° over the distance from the Nansen Ice Shelf edge out 99 km eastward toward the Ross Sea. Maximum velocity winds (jet cores) at 173, 238, 179 and 144 m elevation were associated with atmospheric boundary layers capped by temperature inversions with bases at 294, 325, 226 and 196 m elevation. The tops of the inversion layers (near 700 m at all locations) also marked the top of the katabatic wind layer. Boundary layer air temperature and specific humidity increased from −31 to −21°C and 0.1 to 0.6 gkg<SUP>−1</SUP>, respectively, in response to the warm polynya surface. The air at 15 ± 8 m elevation was saturated with respect to ice, causing supersaturation and snow growth where the air parcels become cooler in the upper atmospheric boundary layer. The surface was characterized by three zones, a fluid zone (open ocean, frazil, shuga and pancake floes), an accumulation zone (fused, rafted and compressed pancake floes) and a young floe zone (large floes). The surface temperature varied from freezing (−1.7°C) in the fluid zone to near air temperature (−20°C) in the floe zone with the largest horizontal surface temperature gradient occurring in the transition between the fluid zone and the accumulation zone, and at the edges of leads in the floe zone.",

      "abstract": "Data from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) on Adelie Land, Antarctica, were analysed. The findings are: (1) The high directional constancy of surface winds, which has been explained by the inversion strength and topography of the slope, was found at the slope stations even in summer when the inversion is weak or destroyed. An analysis of data and model simulations of diurnal variations of katabatic winds in summer show that synoptic geostrophic winds and eddy viscosity also effect the constancy of the wind direction in summer. (2) Wind directional constancies at the slope stations in winter, when the inversion is expected to be stronger than that in summer, are sometimes lower than the mean annual constancies. These low constancies are associated with warm air advection from maritime air brought into Adelie Land when the continental anticyclonic ridge lies to the east of Adelie Land. (3) There is a superadiabatic surface temperature change between the high plateau and intermediate plateau stations. The comparison of the terms in the total pressure gradient force showed that the superadiabatic surface temperature change along the slope could be of importance for surface flow when the buoyancy component is balanced or nearly balanced by an increase in depth of the katabatic wind layer. (4) The entrainment of blowing snow particles increases the density of the katabatic flow layer by two mechanisms: first, by the addition of snow particles to the air column; and second, by the sublimation of the snow particles. This increase in density in the katabatic flow layer leads to increased wind speed. This accelerative effect occurs primarily at wind speeds exceeding 12 m/s, since at those high wind speeds there is usually a large amount of blowing snow.",

      "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with numerical and analytical modellig of over sloping terrain, also called katabatic winds. These winds are induced when a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer is cooled from below. A horizontal potential temperature difference is produced between an air parcel close to the slope and one further away but at the same height, providing the near-surface air parcel with a negative buoyancy force with respect to its environment, which will make the air descend down the slope. Katabatic winds are characterized by persisting wind profiles exhibiting a wind maximum of the order of several metres per second. The wind maximum is normally located close to the surface. Consequently, the wind profiles have large vertical gradients, and the associated wind shear is a key factor in the production of turbulence. Turbulence is an important feature of katabatic winds; it is responsible for the vertical mixing of momentum and heat in the lowest part of the boundary layer. The mixing effectively transports heat from the boundary layer to the ground, thus acting to heat the surface. The numerical technique called large-eddy simulation (LES) is used to study katabatic winds. First, numerical results are validated by comparison with observations. Numerical results of first order moments agree rather well with the observations. Less satisfactory results for the comparison of observed higher-order moments with the numerical results are a result of low-quality observations and idealized setting in the simulations. Katabatic winds are moderated by several factors such the surface forcing (e.g. buoyancy flux), stratification of the ambient atmosphere, and the slope angle. The effect of one single factor is virtually impossible to determine from in-situ measurements. LES is therefore employed to study the effects of the three aforementioned variables on katabatic winds. The results show that the height and magnitude of the katabatic wind maximum increase with increasing surface buoyancy flux, but decrease with larger slope angle and ambient stratification. The negative buoyancy in the katabatic layer increases for larger surface buoyancy fluxes and smaller slope angles, whereas it is only slightly affected by a change in the stratification of the ambient atmosphere. The LES results of the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget show in the bulk of the boundary layer an approximate balance between shear production and turbulent dissipation of TKE. Near the wind maximum height, the balance is between the (positive) turbulent transport of TKE and turbulent dissipation. A newly developed analytical model of katabatic flows induced by an infinitely long cold strip with limited width is also discussed. Due to the inhomogeneous surface forcing in the cross-slope direction, the buoyancy and downslope velocity fields have maximum values at the centre of the strip, which spread outward in the cross-slope direction. The cross-slope variation in the surface buoyancy produces cross-slope and slope-normal velocities. These two velocity fields combined show the present of two vortices near each strip edge.",

      "abstract": "Southeast Greenland is known for strong wind events that result from the interaction of the atmospheric flow with the high topography. Amongst these are intense down-slope winds with a significant katabatic component ('katabatic' hereafter) that are particularly pronounced in Ammassalik, where they have caused significant destruction in local villages. These winds are exceptionally strong in Sermilik Fjord, where Helheim Glacier discharges, and limited visible images suggest that they may have a strong impact on the fjord and its sea-ice and iceberg cover. By affecting the ice-mélange at the edge of Helheim Glacier, these winds can therefore potentially impact glacier stability and may have played a role in the most recent acceleration and retreat of Helheim. In this presentation we identify strong katabatic wind events in Sermilik Fjord using data from two meteorological stations and the reanalysis product ERA-Interim. By combining these data and products, we are able to build a composite of their local and regional characteristics. Next, using a variety of remote sensing products, we investigate their impact on the ice cover in the fjord and shelf. Our results show that these winds tend to shift and remove ice from the fjord, including near Helheim Glacier. Finally, we investigate the relation between katabatic winds and the terminus position of Helheim Glacier over the last decade.",

      "abstract": "The surface wind field inland of the intense coastal katabatic wind regime at Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, has been studied both observationally and numerically. Airborne surveys of wind-induced features on the snow surface have been used to construct the time-averaged winter surface airflow pattern. The surface motion field has also been simulated by a mesoscale primitive equation model using terrain slopes with a horizontal resolution of 32 km. Both methods of analysis demonstrate that the intense katabatic airstream at Terra Nova Bay is forced by converging air currents in the continental interior. The broadscale confluence zone becomes organized ito tow regions within about 180 km of the coast. The primary route for katabatic mass transport into the Terra Nova Bay area is Reeves Glacier valley, but an important secondary source is provided by airflow down David Glacier. The former is generated by the Coriolis-induced concentration of mass transport on the left side (looking downwind) of the broadscale confluence zone as well as by the near-coastal mountain deflection of airflow into the valley head. The confluence zone feeding into David Glacier valley stretches over 100 km into the interior and is forced by the broadscale terrain configuration of the ice sheet. <P />Source areas for the two airstreams differ with Reeves Glacier valley being fed by cold air formed well into the interior, whereas the airflow down David Glacier is sustained by radiative cooling over lower parts of the ice sheet which are much closer to the Ross Sea. Evaluation of the observational and modeling results reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Airborne surveys of sastrugi orientations are a highly successful method for establishing the detailed pattern of surface airflow. However, a systematic examination of sastrugi dimensions suggests that such work could also be carried out using SPOT-type satellite observations, which is a more cost-effective approach than aircraft surveying. The double-jet structure of katabatic airflow into the Terra Nova Bay area is well represented by the primitive equation modeling, but much finer grids are needed to resolve the near-coastal drainage details.",

(1) Entrainment is known to be present in katabatic jets and has been estimated at the interface between the jet and the boundary layer above it. However, to our knowledge, the slope-normal velocity component has never been measured in the katabatic jet. (2) It is hard to accurately measure turbulence in the first tens of centimetres above the surface using standard sonic anemometry due to the filtering effect of the long instrument path. The present field experiment used a three-dimensional multi-hole pitot-type probe with a high sampling frequency (1250 Hz) that was positioned as close to the surface as 3 cm. It provides three-dimensional mean velocity and Reynolds stress tensor from which dissipation can be estimated, as well as spectra for the turbulent quantities. Energy spectra reveal a well-developed inertial range and capture the inertial scales and some of the dissipative scales. (3) Measuring turbulence on a mast usually provides information about mean and turbulent quantities at certain discrete heights because the sensors are sparsely located inside the jet. We present the first measurements of well-developed katabatic flows where the full wind-speed and temperature profiles acquired, from tethered balloon are available at the location of the measurement mast, which comprises three-dimensional anemometry and thermometry.",

This parameterization relies on a comparison of the atmospheric surface circulation simulated by the model with the one provided by a regional atmospheric model, and consists of wind stress corrections in the vicinity of the Antarctic coast. Corrections are spatially varying and different for both wind components. The impacts of the parameterization on the modelled Antarctic sea ice and World Ocean's properties on long timescales are assessed, showing that katabatic winds thin sea ice and strongly enhance its production along the continent. Consequently, the formation rate, salinity and temperature of the Antarctic Bottom Water are increased. This leads to model results in better agreement with observations, especially in the deep ocean where the mean errors on temperature and salinity decrease by 9 % and 37 %, respectively. Hence, parameterizing katabatic winds seems to be an appropriate way to improve the representation of sea ice-related surface processes around Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "Surface fluxes and atmospheric boundary layer budgets of enthalpy and momentum are quantified using bulk and integral methods based on measurements obtained during a research vessel transect across the Terra Nova Bay polynya during an intense late autumnal katabatic wind event. The surface sensible, latent, and net radiation heat fluxes had maximum upward values of 2,500 ± 600, 400 ± 100, and 100 ± 7 Wm<SUP>−2</SUP>, respectively, which occurred over open regions that had been cleared of sea ice by the wind stress. In these open areas, sea spray enhanced the sensible and latent heat fluxes (LHFs) by an estimated 106% and 18%, respectively. As sea ice formed on the surface and became thicker in the downwind direction, the sensible and LHFs decreased to 50% of their maximum values over pancake ice and to 5% at the downwind end of the transect, where snow-covered young ice flows were present. Snow growth removed over 50% of the water vapor that came from the surface. The surface wind stress ranged from mean values of 2.9 Nm<SUP>−2</SUP> in the most upwind regions to 0.9 Nm<SUP>−2</SUP> at the end of the transect, with smaller scale variations of almost a factor of three due to different surface types (roughnesses) and gustiness. The downwind slowing and turning of the wind vector can be almost entirely explained by frictional and inertial forces, indicating the horizontal pressure gradient was weak. This case could serve as a case study for future modeling studies of coastal polynyas.",

      "abstract": "The Antarctic surface wind field is dominated by a persistent katabatic flow from the interior towards the coast. Downslope winds are a result of mainly two forcing components: (1) the katabatic force (KF), which contains the forcing from a temperature inversion over sloping terrain and (2) the synoptic force (SF), which is the superimposed pressure gradient force in the free atmosphere above the inversion layer. If the slope ends close to the coastline and/or if appropriate synoptic forcing is present, wind of katabatic origin can contribute to the formation of coastal polynyas. These coastal polynyas are frequent in the Weddell Sea Region even in winter and have a strong impact on ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. Through the enhanced energy exchange between ocean and atmosphere, these areas are known as strong sea ice producers. In consequence, polynyas have a substantial impact on bottom water formation through the production of new cold and saline water masses during the whole winter season. To investigate the polynya dynamics associated with katabatic winds, high-resolution (5km) atmospheric simulations have been performed for 6 months for the Weddell Sea Region, comprising the autumn and winter season in 2008. The simulations have been carried out using the non-hydrostatic numerical weather prediction model COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale modeling) of the DWD (German Meteorological Service) using GME (Global model extended) analysis from DWD as initial and boundary fields. Daily sea ice coverage is taken from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS) data. A thermodynamic sea ice model is used to simulate the sea ice surface temperatures in the COSMO model. This high-resolution atmospheric dataset was then provided for forcing the sea ice ocean model FESOM (Finite element sea ice ocean model). Linkages between pressure gradient force, composed of its katabatic and synoptic components, offshore wind regimes and polynya area are identified. The surface offshore wind component of Coats land is mainly steered by the katabatic force term. A good correlation between polynya area change and offshore wind is found.",

The theory is based on the depth-integrated momentum and heat equations, and demonstrates an increase in mean velocity $U$ with downstream distance $x$ according to $x^{n}$ ( $n\\leq 1/2$ ). An equation for the mean wind velocity is established, expressing its dependency on the buoyancy flux, related to the heat flux to the ground, entrainment and bottom friction. No ambient stratification, and ambient wind and constant ground surface temperature, lead to $U{\\sim} x^{1/2}$ , while constant heat flux to the ground leads to $U{\\sim} x^{1/3}$ and requires that the reduced gravity decreases as $x^{-1/3}$ . Stable ambient stratification $N$ causes, in addition to small-amplitude mean flow oscillations, a decrease in reduced gravity with $x$ , in which case the assumption of constant surface heat flux along $x$ is only an approximation. The turbulent fluxes are a function of gradient Richardson number $Ri$ with the ratio of turbulent diffusivity to viscosity $K_h/K_m$ changing from nearly $1.4$ to approximately $0.5$ at $Ri\\approx 0.5$ . A new mixing efficiency is introduced that includes turbulence kinetic energy production or consumption by along-slope turbulent buoyancy flux. It increases with $Ri$ up to $0.25$ at $Ri\\approx 0.5$ and then remains nearly constant. The measurements allowed us to determine the bottom drag coefficients and interfacial entrainment, with the ground surface heat flux being determined from the mean buoyancy flux.",

The impact of these winds on the characteristics of small-scale wind waves leads to the formation of characteristic manifestations on the sea surface, which in turn can be seen in SAR images. Satellite SAR data, unlike subsatellite observations, make it possible to see the phenomena in coastal zones and large lakes, estimate their spatial scales, and determine a number of quantitative characteristics. The analysis of the collected SAR images shows that bora-like and foehn-like local winds have similar characteristics and cover vast areas of the inland and marginal seas of the Russian Federation. The similarity of the manifestations of local winds clearly indicates the same physical and aerohydrodynamic mechanisms of their onset and display on SAR images. It is shown that spaceborne SAR data, which are 2D patterns of the 'frozen wind', are extremely useful for studying and monitoring local winds over the seas, especially where the network of weather stations is extremely sparse.",

      "abstract": "Onshore and offshore sedimentological, geochemical, geomorphological, palaeontological and geochronological studies of loess deposits located under and around the English Channel revealed that they were transported by katabatic winds generated by the British–Irish Ice Sheet. Katabatic winds, which are low-altitude wind flows, were able to jump over the low southern British hills but were stopped by the higher Brittany and Normandy hills. This regional topography is interrupted by a north–south corridor linking the northern and southern shores of Brittany where loess propagated down to the mouth of the Loire River. This long transit shows that the total distance travelled by the katabatic wind was around 750 km, which represents an unusual distance for the propagation of this wind under continental conditions. Strong similarities with Antarctica and Greenland, where well documented cases of katabatic winds are known, show that the transit of the trans-Channel katabatic winds were strongly enhanced by the seasonal drift of storms propagating in an eastward direction along the axis of the English Channel. This increasing strength of the north–south katabatic flux was probably at the origin of the transport of loess particles down to the mouth of the Loire River.",

The high-horizontal-resolution (50-200 m) numerical simulations of the local wind flow from katabatic wind fronts show high spatial variability in wind-impact patterns and good congruence between places with high near-surface wind speeds and the blue ice area. In addition we perform wind simulations on an altered glacier geometry that resembles the thicker ice cover at the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM). These simulations indicate that the pronounced spatial wind-impact patterns depend on present-day geometry and did not occur during the LGM. This leads to the conclusion that the formation of the inner blue ice area of the Scharffenbergbotnen valley started only after the lowering of the ice surface, i.e. after the LGM. Experiments with smoothed surface topography suggest that detailed positions of the high wind regions, and hence individual blue ice fields, may have varied as the ice sheet lowered. The simulation results obtained with the present-day geometry were fortuitously confirmed by the destruction of a field camp located in a high-wind-speed area and its subsequent redistribution to low-velocity areas. The experiments and the field observations are consistent with localized violent katabatic events rather than synoptic-scale storms, playing the dominant role in the formation and maintenance of this and perhaps many blue ice areas.",

In summer, the season of interest in this study, coastal weather is characterized by well-marked diel cycles in temperature and wind patterns. Our study aims at exploring the added value of water vapor stable isotopes in coastal Adélie Land to provide new information on the local atmospheric water cycle and climate. An important application is the interpretation of water isotopic profiles in snow and ice cores recently drilled in Adélie Land. We present the first continuous measurements of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and d-excess in water vapor over Adélie Land. During our measurements period (26/12/2016 to 03/02/2017), we observed clear diel cycles in terms of temperature, humidity and isotopic composition. The cycles in isotopic composition are particularly large given the muted variations in temperature when compared to other Antarctic sites where similar monitoring have been performed. Based on data analyses and simulations obtained with the regional MAR model on the coastal Adélie Land, we suggest that the driver for δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and d-excess diel variability in summer at Dumont d'Urville is the variation of the strength of the wind coming from the continent: the periods with strong wind are associated with the arrival of relatively dry air with water vapor associated with low δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and high d-excess from the Antarctic plateau. Finally, in addition to the interpretation of snow and ice core isotopic profiles in the coastal regions, our study has implications for the evaluation of atmospheric models equipped with water isotopes.",

The average stability is near-neutral throughout the year. Roughness heights (Z<SUB>0</SUB>) are estimated from hourly averaged wind speeds at four heights (8, 4, 2, 1, and 1 m) assuming a logarithmic law. Values of Z<SUB>0</SUB> do not vary significantly with wind direction in winter, but they show marked symmetric directional dependence with the smoothest direction around 90° in azimuth in summer. The smoothest direction is formed by the prevailing high wind in a narrow directional range in summer, but it is not formed by high winds in winter because of the scatter over a wider directional range. The results of the first paper can be used throughout the year; C<SUB>d10</SUB> is estimated to be 0.0013, but decreases to 0.00075 in the smoothest direction in summer. The winter value is similar to previous results over a polar snow surface, but the minimum value in summer is smaller than any previous values in the literature.",

In this study \"katabatic wind\" at Maitri over Schirmacher Oasis has been examined using the data collected during the 9th Indian Antarctic Expedition 1990-91. The primary results show that katabatic winds are observed in all the months with higher frequency and strength in winter compared to other seasons.

      "abstract": "We report the first in-situ observations of warm nighttime winds at Gale landing site. Gale is an impact crater basin with 5 km depth and an internal mound of the same height. This sharp topographic contrast induces huge environmental differences after sunset that leads to the appearance of downslope winds. Katabatic winds are produced as the descending mass of air is compressed adiabatically because of the pressure difference. This leads to the injection at the base of the crater of a jet of air with increased temperature. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission has sensors recording air and ground temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and ultraviolet radiation in different bands. REMS collects data from all sensors simultaneously daily during the course of the mission. REMS has detected the signatures of katabatic winds simultaneously in 4 of its sensors: pressure wiggles associated with the incoming mass of air (pressure sensor), sudden air temperature increments up to 10 K (air temperature sensor); an associated modulation in the ground temperature (ground temperature sensor); and variations of strength and orientation indicating a donwnslope wind (wind sensor). The hot air winds observed by REMS show a pattern with a certain characteristic frequency along the nighttime hours. The magnitude and signature of the air temperature increase after sunset changes when the local column of dust increases suggesting a strong dependence on the local circulation of air and local column of dust. Katabatic winds must be ubiquous on Mars given the huge topographic differences of its poorly eroded landscape. These warm nighttime winds prevent cooling of the ground surface and may lead to erroneous thermal inertia estimates when the ground temperature is remotely measured from orbiters, that usually do not take them into account them in the retrieval process. Furthermore the signature of katabatic winds changes along seasons showing a strong dependence with the local atmospheric dynamics and dust loading processes. Finally the rapid surface temperature changes induced by these jets and the systematic orientation associated with the slope may influence the erosional processes and depositional patterns in areas with sharp topographic relief. REMS will monitor daily and hourly all the relevant parameters to study the evolution of katabatic winds providing a unique data-base to pin-point the characteristics of this local weather phenomenon.",

Some historic data from the area are available; however, such measurements were carried out at different places for different time periods. Hence in December 1992, we placed four automatic weather stations along the coast of Adélie Land, two in the maximum wind jet (Port Martin and Cape Denison) and one on each side of this jet (D 10 close to Dumont d'Urville and Penguin Point, respectively). We obtained about three months of good data, as on March 25, 1993, a strong storm destroyed three of the four wind sensors. Wind velocities are discussed as a function of other meteorological parameters. Further, the interrelationships between the stations are described. Some of the findings are (1) the very high wind speeds reported earlier this century are in agreement with our measurements; the wind directional constancy is high; (2) historic measurements reported Cape Denison to be the windiest station, not only for Antarctica, but also close to sea level for planet Earth; again our measurements are in agreement; (3) very strong wind speeds have a more down-slope direction than weaker ones; (4) the general atmospheric pressure gradient enhanced or inhibited the gravity flow; this is especially well pronounced in summer; and (5) in summer, above normal pressure is correlated with above normal temperatures; in fall the opposite holds true.",

While the flow was predominantly katabatic, two types of anabatic flows were detected: 1. (a) an intermittent type resulting from the action of unsteady wave phenomena and 2. (b) a convectively-induced type resulting from the lifting and erosion of nocturnal inversion as the boundary layer deepens following the input of solar radiation by the sun at dawn. Vertical fluxes of zonal and meridional momentum were calculated. The imprint of gravity wave activity was made manifest by these results and spectral analysis of vertical velocities which were in agreement with observed facsimile record signatures.

Hunt (2) (1) Arizona State University, Tempe, (2) University College, London j.fernando@asu.edu Theoretical and field studies were carried out on velocity and temperature fields of an unsteady nighttime atmospheric boundary layer on sloping surfaces. Field data were collected during the Vertical Transport and Mixing Experiment (VTMX) conducted in the Salt Lake basin, Utah. Nighttime data from two slope sites, with measurements taken using six tethersonde systems and three sonic anemometers placed at a various representative locations along the slope, were used in the analysis. This analysis concerned simple katabatic flows as well as the interaction between (evening) down-slope flows on lower (elevation) gentle slopes and those originating at adjoining higher (elevation) steep mountain slopes. Katabatic winds that form on the steep slope overrun those on the lower slope, thus dominating the micrometeorology at the bottom of the valley. Yet, the flow and temperature on higher slopes are independent of those in the lower valley, given that katabatic flows on steeper slopes are generally supercritical and do not transmit flow information upstream. By employing assumptions on the flow structure and using parameterizations for pertinent processes, an expression was derived for the layer-averaged katabatic flow velocity. Using energy arguments to calculate the growth rate of the katabatic-layer thickness, a new expression for the flow depth was derived. Extensive comparisons between theoretical results and field observations were made, allowing cross-fertilization between theoretical developments, eduction of flow physics and interpretation of field data. Unsteady effects pertinent to katabatic flows were also considered, following Fleagle’s approach, and it is shown theoretically and using observations that the down-slope flow pulsates with a period inversely proportional to the background stratification and the slope angle. In concurrence with the theoretical analysis, the down-slope flow was found to pulsate with a longer period on a gentle slope (70 to 130 minutes) and a shorter period on a steeper slope (20 to 50 minutes).",

      "abstract": "Complex feedbacks between katabatic winds and the cryosphere may lead to the development of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described, and named snow megadunes, in Antarctica. Complementary investigations of topographic data, optical images, spectroscopic data and stratigraphic radar soundings reveal that these sedimentation waves generally migrate upwind in response to enhanced accumulation on their upwind sides and reduced (or net ablation) on their downwind sides. On Mars, the North Polar Cap exhibits two wavelengths of such sedimentations waves. (1) The larger ones are several tens of kilometers in wavelength and several hundreds of meters in amplitude. These large bedforms confer a stunning spiral-shaped topography to the NPC. They have been interpreted as cyclic steps systems associated with katabatic jumps. (2) The smaller ones are tens of kilometers in wavelength and several tens of meters in amplitude. They are superimposed on the larger ones and are probable Martian equivalents of terrestrial snow megadunes. These specific bedforms have morphologic, stratigraphic and dynamic similarities with underwater sedimentary antidunes. Sedimentation waves on Earth and Mars result from the interaction between katabatic winds and the redistribution of ice at the surface of the NPC. Ice sublimation and condensation play an important role in the development of sedimentation waves on the NPC, due to the low atmospheric pressure, low temperature and low water vapor content at the surface of Mars. We are currently developing a numerical model based on the coupled implementation of fluid dynamics and H2O mass transfer by sublimation and condensation. The model is designed to explore the implication of the interaction between katabatic winds and water vapor diffusion/transport on the development of sedimentation waves on Mars and could be extrapolated to Antarctic conditions.",

The margins of Antarctica are characterized by persistent katabatic winds, supplying the low level of the atmosphere with air masses of low relative humidity, originating from the elevated Antarctic plateau. Despite the importance of these winds for the climate of coastal regions, their interaction with snowfall has not been quantified so far. In this contribution, we show, using unprecedented remotely-sensed data (X-band and long series of K-band radar data) collected in Dumont d'Urville on the coast of Adélie Land, that katabatic winds lead to a significant low-level sublimation of snowfall. At the scale of individual precipitation events, sublimation is inversely proportional to the intensity of precipitation, because more developed systems can extend further into the continent and eventually saturate the low levels of the atmosphere. This phenomenon is reproduced as well with the simulations of three different atmospheric models, that are used to extend our findings to the entire continent. In quantitative terms, sublimation in the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere, before deposition, accounts for about 17% of total snowfall over the entire continent and up to 35% on the margins of East Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "This research project has evaluated the sensitivity of numerically simulated Antarctic katabatic winds to variations in the numerical model configuration used. Specifically changes in the physical parameterizations employed (surface layer, planetary boundary layer, and longwave radiative transfer parameterizations), model dynamics (hydrostatic or nonhydrostatic), and model formulation [the Parish model (a mesoscale model developed at the University of Wyoming) and the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5)] were evaluated. The atmospheric mass transport in the katabatic layer was used as a measure of the sensitivity of the simulated flows. It was found that this quantity varied by as much as a factor of two for the model formulation sensitivity cases. Smaller variations in this quantity were found when the physical parameterizations or model dynamics were varied, although even these smaller changes were significant in terms of the evolution of the katabatic flow. In addition to the sensitivity studies, two of the physical parameterizations (the surface layer and longwave radiative transfer parameterizations) were verified with available observations. Three surface layer parameterizations were verified with three years of mid- winter observations from the British Antarctic Survey research station Halley (75°S, 26°W). It was found that for the three surface layer parameterizations tested all reproduced the observed friction velocity with acceptable accuracy, but that the surface sensible heat flux calculated by these parameterizations was in generally poor agreement with the observations. Two longwave radiative transfer parameterizations were verified with data collected on three cloud free days at South Pole station (90°S). Good agreement was found between the observations and the longwave radiative transfer parameterizations.",

      "abstract": "The near-surface airflow over most of the Antarctic continent is dominated by gravity-driven winds produced by radiational cooling of the sloping ice sheet. The most spectacular manifestation of this katabatic flow is the extraordinarily strong and persistent wind regime along portions of the Adelie Coast. One- and two-dimensional versions of a mesoscale meteorological model are used in an attempt to advance the fundamental understanding of katabatic winds in an Antarctic context. It is found that the 1-D simulations diverge from slope wind theory in some aspects because of the inclusion of the effect of the earth's rotation and because of the interactive diabatic cooling process produced by model parameterizations. The two-dimensional results demonstrate the importance of processes occurring at the ends of a slope of finite extent and reveal the differences between flow on a uniform slope and on an Antarctic -type slope, where the terrain slope angle increases from the interior toward the coast. The full three-dimensional model is used to investigate an ideal \"confluence zone\" which can produce winds of comparable strength to those observed on the Adelie Coast. The existence of a significant transverse circulation highlights the three-dimensional nature of Antarctic winds produced by relatively minor lateral terrain variations.",

      "abstract": "A particularity of the glacier areas is the quasi persistence of strong offshore winds near the surface. The so-called katabatic winds are generated by the negative buoyant force that develops in the stable cooled layer along the ice sheet slopes. Katabatic winds exist in many parts of the world and are winds that flow from the high elevations of mountains, plateaus, and hills down their slopes to the valleys or planes below. They provide the major ventilation mechanism in mountainous regions at night when synoptic pressure gradients are weak. Katabatic winds are the main components of the climate at glaciers and surrounding areas, in particular, at the Antarctica, Greenland, and Arctic islands. Our experiments were carried out near the Kongsvegen glacier in Svalbard during the spring time. Some preliminary observational results from the ground-based measurements during the field experiment in Ny-Alesund at spring time are presented. The predominant flow at Ny-Alesund is from the east-southeast due to katabatic flow from the Kongsvegen glacier 10 km to the east of Ny-Alesund. Neutral conditions were observed from the two predominant wind directions centered in the 120° and 250° sectors. A minor peak with the 20% of unstable cases was observed at 245° while stable conditions were mainly distributed around the sector at 120°. The highest values of the sensible heat fluxes were observed during the day time under forced convection because of the transfer of warmer upper layer air into the surface layer. The dependence of incoming longwave and shortware radiation on cloud amount has been parameterized using relationships reported in the literature. Generally good agreement exists between the measured values and the parameterized those, except the cases of wind blowing from neighboring mountains. For the latent and sensible heat fluxes a new parameterization has been chosen for introducing into the model. The parameterization has been tested for measurement values. The funding for this research was provided by RFBR and NWO (N 07-05-92311).",

Snowdrift sublimation is found to be the major contributor to the total surface-atmosphere moisture flux in strong winds (equivalent latent heat fluxes up to 250 W m<SUP>2</SUP>), during which surface sublimation becomes negligible because of formation of a near-surface saturated layer. Both surface and snowdrift sublimation interact strongly with the surface moisture budget of the near-surface atmospheric layer. The sum of surface and snowdrift sublimation rates compares reasonably well with the directly measured latent heat fluxes. On average, surface and snowdrift sublimation contributed about equally to the total latent heat flux of 13.1 W m<SUP>2</SUP> at one site, whereas snowdrift sublimation was estimated to contribute two-thirds of the total sublimation at three other sites. Spatial variations in snowdrift sublimation depend on differences in wind speed, temperature, and humidity in a complex manner. For instance, the highest and windiest location, with the largest snowdrift transport rates, experienced the lowest sublimation rates because of low ambient temperatures.",

      "abstract": "Satellite images occasionally show the existence of mesocyclones (MCs) close to the eastern coast of Greenland, especially in the region of Angmagssalik/Tasiilaq. The forcing mechanisms of such MCs are investigated by means of numerical simulations with a three-dimensional mesoscale model. The special characteristics of the East Greenland topography are shown to be a key factor for the development of the MCs. The channeling of the flow in large valleys along the East Greenland coast leads to a convergence, implying a vertical stretching of the flow through the valleys and the generation of cyclonic vorticity. This convergence can be strong during intense katabatic storms, so-called Piteraqs, which are a much-feared phenomenon in that area of Greenland. During these situations the synoptic environment enforces the katabatic flow. The results of the simulations suggest a close relationship between the occurrence of Piteraqs and the generation of mesoscale vortices close to the East Greenland coast. An improved understanding of these processes will help forecasters to advise aircraft and ship operations near the coast of East Greenland. Copyright",

      "abstract": "The major topographic features of the martian polar layered deposits include the conspicuous spiral troughs, subtle undulations, broad reentrants (chasma), steep, arcuate scarps, and dune fields. A prominent role for eolian processes in the formation of all of these features is proposed. Strong katabatic winds occur on the north polar cap, producing widespread frost streaks. These cold drainage winds are analogous to those on the terrestrial Antarctic cap. In the chasmae convergent katabatic winds create yardangs and erode arcuate scarps in the layered deposits that are also the source for local dune fields migrating outward from the polar cap. The chasmae are postulated to originate by long-term erosion by katabatic wind. Wind plays a role in formation of the troughs and scarps primarily through removal of dust freed from exposed layered deposits by ablation of ice on defrosted equator-facing slopes. The undulations are created by interaction between surface erosion or deposition of perennial ice and standing waves in the shallow katabatic windflow. The south polar layered deposits exhibit topographic features similar to those at the north polar cap, but erosion and depositional processes creating these features may be inactive during the current epoch because of the lack of an extensive perennial ice cover and associated katabatic wind.",

As predicted by McNider (1982) oscillations along the slope are expected to occur if the fluid is stably-stratified, as a result of buoyancy and adiabatic cooling/warming effects. Internal gravity waves must also be generated by the katabatic flows because of the stable stratification. The aim of the present paper is to identify and characterize the oscillations in the katabatic flow as well as the internal gravity wave field emitted by this flow. Numerical simulations with the ARPS code are performed for this purpose, for an idealized configuration of the Chamonix valley. We show that the oscillations near the slope are non propagating motions, whose period is well predicted by the single particle model of McNider (1982) and equal to 10 to 11 mn. As for the wave field, its frequency is close to 0.85 N, where N is the value of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency in the generation region of the waves, consistently with previous academic studies of wave emission by turbulent motions in a stratified fluid. This leads to a wave period of 7 to 8 mn.",

      "abstract": "A method is proposed to evaluate the coupled mass, momentum and thermal energy budget equations for a deep valley under two-dimensional, steady-state flow conditions. The method requires the temperature, down- valley wind and valley width fields to be approximated by simple analytical functions. The vertical velocity field is calculated using the mass continuity equation. Advection terms in the momentum and energy equations are then calculated using finite differences computed on a vertical two-dimensional grid that runs down the valley's axis. The pressure gradient term in the momentum equation is calculated from the temperature field by means of the hydrostatic equation. The friction term is then calculated as a residual in the xmomentum equation, and the diabatic cooling term is calculated as a residual in the thermal energy budget equation.The method is applied to data from an 8-km-long segment of Colorado's; Brush Creek Valley on the night of 30-31 July 1982. Pressure decreased with distance down the peak on horizontal surfaces, with peak horizontal pressure gradients of 0.04 hPa km<SUP>1</SUP>. The valley mass budget indicated that subsidence was required in the valley to support calculated mean along-valley mass flux divergence. Peak subsidence rates on the order of 0.10 m s<SUP>1</SUP> were calculated. Subsiding motions in the valley produced negative vertical down-valley momentum fluxes in the upper valley atmosphere, but produced positive down-valley momentum fluxes below the level of the jet. Friction, calculated as a residual in the x momentum equation, was negative, as expected on physical grounds. and attained reasonable quantitative values.The strong subsidence field in the stable valley atmosphere produced subsidence warming that was only partly counteracted by down-valley cold air advection. Strong diabatic cooling was therefore required in order to account for the weak net cooling of the valley atmosphere during the nighttime period when tethered balloon observations were made.",

      "abstract": "In the summer of 1994, meteorological measurements were performed on Pasterze Glacier in the eastern Alps. One of the most remarkable observations concerning the observed climate was the persistent glacier wind. On the relatively large glacier, which has a length of 9.6 km, the gravity wind at the lower parts of the glacier is well developed and has a thickness of about 100 m. To determine the mechanisms that cause the steady-state glacier wind, the author calculated its vertically integrated budgets of momentum, heat, and moisture at a spot on the lower glacier tongue. It was found that the sum of interfacial and surface friction account for only half of the momentum dissipation of the glacier wind; the rest of the katabatic force is most probably balanced by the mesoscale pressure gradient that drives the valley wind above the katabatic layer. The heat and moisture budgets of the boundary layer show simple two-term balances: heat is lost through the turbulent flux of sensible heat at the surface (on average 50 W m<SUP>2</SUP>) and gained by the downward transport of air. Moisture is added to the katabatic layer by entrainment and lost through condensation at the surface, but on average the moisture fluxes are small. The entrainment velocity, averaged over the length of the glacier, was estimated to be 2.4 cm s<SUP>1</SUP>; it reduces to 0.7 cm s<SUP>1</SUP> at the glacier tongue, which was estimated by closing the local moisture budget.",

      "abstract": "Climate observations from the McMurdo dry valleys, East Antarctica are presented from a network of seven valley floor automatic meteorological stations during the period 1986 to 2000. Mean annual temperatures ranged from -14.8°C to -30.0°C, depending on the site and period of measurement. Mean annual relative humidity is generally highest near the coast. Mean annual wind speed increases with proximity to the polar plateau. Site-to-site variation in mean annual solar flux and PAR is due to exposure of each station and changes over time are likely related to changes in cloudiness. During the nonsummer months, strong katabatic winds are frequent at some sites and infrequent at others, creating large variation in mean annual temperature owing to the warming effect of the winds. Katabatic wind exposure appears to be controlled to a large degree by the presence of colder air in the region that collects at low points and keeps the warm less dense katabatic flow from the ground. The strong influence of katabatic winds makes prediction of relative mean annual temperature based on geographical position (elevation and distance from the coast) alone, not possible. During the summer months, onshore winds dominate and warm as they progress through the valleys creating a strong linear relationship (r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.992) of increasing potential temperature with distance from the coast (0.09°C km<SUP>-1</SUP>). In contrast to mean annual temperature, summer temperature lends itself quite well to model predictions, and is used to construct a statistical model for predicting summer dry valley temperatures at unmonitored sites.",

      "abstract": "As a first step toward improving the present understanding of the physics that control air-sea CO<SUB>2</SUB> exchange in the Southern Ocean, a coupled mesoscale atmosphere-ocean-sea ice model is described and used to examine the interaction of Antarctic katabatic winds with coastal ocean and sea ice processes. These winds are a dominant factor in shaping the climatology of Antarctica, particularly during the austral winter. Simulations are presented for winter and early spring conditions. For the spring case a simple primary productivity model is used to examine the early stages of phytoplankton bloom development. Latent heat polynyas are a common feature along the Antarctic coast. These ice-free regions are maintained by a balance between wind driven ice divergence and ice production. For the winter simulation the coupled model creates an initial polynya that closes after 4 days of simulation. The closing of the polynya is linked to the adjustment of the katabatic winds to the alongshore direction which forces shoreward Ekman transport of the sea ice, closing the polynya. Seasonal variations in the magnitude of the katabatic flows are linked to variations in the strength of the East Wind Drift. During the winter, the offshore directed katabtic winds adjust geostrophically, contributing to the strong polar easterlies of high southern latitudes. Shoreward Ekman transport associated with these easterlies supports a barotropic coastal current, the East Wind Drift. During spring the adjustment process is interrupted by the diurnal cycle, weakening the Ekman transport and the coastal current. Phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean are typically linked to the retreat of the seasonal ice cover. As the sea ice melts the associated input of fresh water stabilizes the surface layer of the ocean limiting the depth of turbulent mixing. In early spring, sea ice coverage, incoming solar irradiance and wind stress are shown to be the major factors contributing to early bloom development. Polynyas are shown to provide a favorable environment for bloom development even in the absence of fresh water input.",

      "abstract": "The measurements taken during the Vertical Transport and Mixing Experiment (VTMX, October, 2000) on a northeastern slope of Salt Lake Valley, Utah, were used to calculate the statistics of velocity fluctuations in a katabatic gravity current in the absence of synoptic forcing. The data from ultrasonic anemometer-thermometers placed at elevations 4.5 and 13.9 m were used. The contributions of small-scale turbulence and waves were isolated by applying a high-pass digital (Elliptical) filter, whereupon the filtered quantities were identified as small-scale turbulence and the rest as internal gravity waves. Internal waves were found to play a role not only at canonical large gradient Richardson numbers <inline-formula id=\"IEq1\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>Ri</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, but sometimes at smaller values <inline-formula id=\"IEq2\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>Ri</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, in contrast to typical observations in flat-terrain stable boundary layers. This may be attributed, at least partly, to (critical) internal waves on the slope, identified by Princevac et al. [1], which degenerate into turbulence and help maintain an active internal wave field. The applicability of both Monin-Obukhov (MO) similarity theory and local scaling to filtered and unfiltered data was tested by analyzing rms velocity fluctuations as a function of the stability parameter z/L, where L is the Obukhov length and z the height above the ground. For weaker stabilities, <inline-formula id=\"IEq3\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>z/L</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the MO similarity and local scaling were valid for both filtered and unfiltered data.

As indicated in the Table, the annual mean wind recorded at those stations, 71·1 and 64·6 km per h respectively, is about 70 per cent greater than recorded elsewhere around the coast at stations fully exposed to katabatic flow, notably Mirny and Mawson. Admittedly, the total number of coastal stations is small, considering the length of the Antarctic coastline, and one cannot exclude the possibility that similar very strong winds prevail in other places. Nevertheless, the figures for Cape Denison and Port Martin are notable, if not unique, and the question arises why this should occur on the coast of Terre Adélie.",

      "abstract": "The katabatic winds on steep slopes investigated in the present study reveal a novel spectral behavior, observed in the outer part of the jet. At low wavenumbers, the one-dimensional (1D) velocity spectra show evidence of a k x - 1 range for the three components of the velocity vector: E u ( k x ) , E v ( k x ) , E w ( k x ) ∝ k x - 1 [as well as for the 1D temperature spectrum E θ ( k x ) ∝ k x - 1]. This suggests the existence of strong wave turbulence. A necessary condition for strong wave turbulence to be manifest is that the flow direction wavenumber, k<SUB>x</SUB>, extends to much lower values than the slope normal one, k<SUB>z</SUB>. This is satisfied in the present field experiment where wave energy is injected at wavenumber k x = k N = ( N a sin α ) / u j ¯, while k z ∼ 1 / Δ z, with N<SUB>a</SUB> the ambient stratification, α the slope angle, u j ¯ the maximum wind velocity, and Δ z the shear layer thickness of the jet. In the inertial range, the velocity spectra exhibit a power law k x - 5 / 3 over two decades, whereas the temperature-buoyancy spectra show evidence of a - 7 / 5 slope in the buoyancy sub-range, followed by a - 5 / 3 slope. The change in spectral slopes occurs at the Bolgiano scale L<SUB>B</SUB> that is close to the Dougherty-Ozmidov scale L<SUB>OZ</SUB>. The high Reynolds number based on the Taylor micro-scale, R e λ ∼ 10 3, allows clear identification of the spectral laws.",

These wind events could potentially be an important mechanism for the ventilation of fjord waters. A strong wind event was observed in Andvord Bay in December 2015, and was associated with significant increases in upper-ocean salinity. We examine the dynamical impacts of such wind events during the ice-free summer season using a numerical model. Passive tracers are used to identify water mass pathways and quantify exchange with the outer ocean. Upwelling and outflow in the model fjord generate an average salinity increase of 0.3 in the upper ocean during the event, similar to observations from Andvord Bay. Down-fjord wind events are a highly efficient mechanism for flushing out the upper fjord waters, but have little net impact on deep waters in the inner fjord. As such, summer episodic wind events likely have a large effect on fjord phytoplankton dynamics and export of glacially modified upper waters, but are an unlikely mechanism for the replenishment of deep basin waters and oceanic heat transport toward inner-fjord glaciers.",

Whereas the surface is usually at the meltingpoint, the temperatures in the free atmosphere areabove freezing. The depth of the boundary layer, in whichthe wind turns to the free atmosphere direction, is notmuch more than 100 m. The surface wind is always aboutfrom the southeast (hence with a downslope component),whereas winds from the southwest (with an upslopecomponent) often occur at the 100 m level. Mixing length profiles for momentum were estimatedby comparison of calculated and observed windprofiles. A good accordance between calculated andobserved wind speed was obtained. The neutralmixing length had a maximum of only a few metres, whichwas approached already at low height.

      "abstract": "The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) has been performing model calculations in support of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. <BR /> Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. <BR /> In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at &lt;a href=\"www.emep.int\"target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.emep.int&lt;/a&gt;, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe.",

Detailed examination of the line shape of the conductance versus density provides a new insight into the transport mechanism.",

      "abstract": "We present 4 years of near-surface radiation balance observations of four Antarctic automatic weather stations (AWS). The AWS are situated along a traverse line in Dronning Maud Land, connecting the coastal ice shelf and the inland plateau via the katabatic wind zone, covering the three major climate regimes of East Antarctica. Important differences in the radiation balance of the three regions are found. Clouds not only limit atmospheric transmissivity for shortwave radiation but also strongly enhance the albedo for the shortwave radiation that reaches the surface. As a result, the snow surface of the coastal ice shelves absorbs up to 65% less shortwave radiation in high summer than at the high plateau, where cloudy episodes and precipitation events are less frequent. In winter, over the slopes, katabatic winds maintain a continuous turbulent transport of sensible heat toward the surface, which enhances outgoing longwave radiation. As a result, the katabatic wind zone shows the largest longwave and all-wave radiation loss in winter and over the year. Clear-sky effective emissivity for incoming longwave radiation shows great spatial variability resulting from differences in vertical temperature and moisture profiles among the various climate zones.",

      "abstract": "A density current model was extended for use in katabatic flow over the steep slopes of Antarctica through the inclusion of the Coriolis effect and weight flux terms corresponding to blowing snow and cooling caused by sublimation. The model was calibrated and tested against data obtained during two flights in Adelie Land, Antarctica, along a trajectory starting about 170 km inland and extending to Dumont d'Urville. The predicted trend in water vapor flux agrees with measurements of this flux, lending support to empirical formulae for both snow flux and sublimation rate. Model predictions of velocity were in good agreement with measured quantities when reasonable estimates of radiation divergence and surface heat exchange were provided as input to the model. The potential temperature gradient above the katabatic layer was found to play a major role in flow stability for high velocity and deep katabatic flows. Velocity predictions were in better agreement with the data when a locally determined value was used for the coefficient in the empirical snow flux expression.",

      "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.",

      "abstract": "Observations performed in the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet and over the adjacent tundra in the summer of 1991 are described. The experimental area is the region near Søndre Strømfjord (67°N, 54°W), which is relatively dry and sunny, resulting in the highest mean temperature in Greenland in July. The katabatic wind is dominantly present over the ice; it influences the energy balance near the surface through the sensible and latent heat flux. With the aid of a tethered balloon it was observed that the thickness of the katabatic layer is typically 100 to 200 m. An interesting aspect of the katabatic wind appears to be the acceleration of the flow in the late afternoon due to the large temperature gradient at the border between tundra and ice. Further on the ice, this effect is no longer important for the dynamics of the katabatic flow. The net radiation is the main driving force there. An attempt is made to estimate the importance of these thermal wind effects compared to the buoyancy forcing. It is concluded that near the edge of the ice surface winds are driven by the horizontal pressure gradient, imposed by the thermal contrast between tundra and ice. A comparison is made between the observed katabatic wind and those in the Antarctic.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over a \"receptor\" region to emission changes over a foreign \"source\" region is key to evaluating the potential gains from an international approach to abate ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) pollution. We apply an ensemble of 21 global and hemispheric chemical transport models to estimate the spatial average surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over east Asia (EA), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and south Asia (SA) to 20% decreases in anthropogenic emissions of the O<SUB>3</SUB> precursors, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO (individually and combined), from each of these regions. We find that the ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations in the base case (year 2001) simulation matches available observations throughout the year over EU but overestimates them by &gt;10 ppb during summer and early fall over the eastern United States and Japan. The sum of the O<SUB>3</SUB> responses to NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental-scale \"import sensitivity\" as the ratio of the O<SUB>3</SUB> response to the 20% reductions in foreign versus \"domestic\" (i.e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0.6 ppb over EU (0.4 ppb from NA), less than the 0.8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0.7. The ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0.7-0.9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0.8-1.6 ppb). High O<SUB>3</SUB> values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0.2 to 0.3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O<SUB>3</SUB> levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8-h average O<SUB>3</SUB> above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region (&lt;10-20% of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50% of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O<SUB>3</SUB> of about 0.1 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP>, at the low end of the 0.1-0.5 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP> derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20% reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O<SUB>3</SUB> response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20% reductions of anthropogenic NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign source region.",

      "abstract": "An investigation of time dependent snow accumulation and erosion dynamics in a wind-swept environment was undertaken at two automatic weather stations sites on the Ross Ice Shelf between January 1994 and November 1995 using newly developed instrumentation employing a technique which automatically disperses inert, colored (high albedo) glass microspheres onto the snow surface at fixed intervals throughout the year. The microspheres act as a time marker and tracer to allow the accumulation rate and wind erosion processes to be quantified with a high temporal resolution. Snow core and snow pit sampling was conducted twice during the study period to identify microsphere horizons in the annual snow accumulation profile, allowing the snow accumulation/erosion events to be reconstructed. The two sites chosen for this investigation have characteristically different mean wind speeds and therefore allow a comparative examination on the role of wind on ice sheet growth. Mass accumulation rate at the two sites for the 14-day integration periods available ranged from 0.0 to &gt;2.0 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. The mean mass accumulation rate during the study period was greater at the site with stronger winds (0.69 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>) than the site with lower mean wind speeds (0.61 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>); however, the difference between the two means is not statistically significant. Accumulation rates derived from an ultrasonic snow depth gauge operated at one of the sites are compared to the actual tracer-derived accumulation rates and show the limitations of only having a measure of snow surface height with no instantaneous measurements of the snow density profile. Snow depth gauge derived accumulation rates were found to be greatly overestimated during high-accumulation periods and were greatly underestimated during low-accumulation periods.",

We characterized the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in large cohorts of human colorectal cancers by gene expression profiling and in situ immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the immunological data (the type, density, and location of immune cells within the tumor samples) were found to be a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage colorectal cancer. The results were validated in two additional patient populations. These data support the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors. In situ analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells may therefore be a valuable prognostic tool in the treatment of colorectal cancer and possibly other malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Increasing paleoclimatic evidence suggests that the Little Ice Age (LIA) was a global climate change event. Understanding the forcings and associated climate system feedbacks of the LIA is made difficult by the scarcity of Southern Hemisphere paleoclimate records. We use a new glaciochemical record of a coastal ice core from Mt. Erebus Saddle, Antarctica, to reconstruct atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica over the past five centuries. The LIA is identified in stable isotope (δD) and lithophile element records, which respectively demonstrate that the region experienced 1.6 ± 1.4 °C cooler average temperatures prior to 1850 AD than during the last 150 yr and strong (&gt;57 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) prevailing katabatic winds between 1500 and 1800 AD. Al and Ti concentration increases of an order of magnitude (&gt;120 ppb Al) are linked to enhanced aeolian transport of complex silicate minerals and represent the strongest katabatic wind events of the LIA. These events are associated with three 12-30 yr intervals of cooler temperatures at ca. 1690 AD, 1770 AD and 1840 AD. Furthermore, ice core concentrations of the biogenic sulphur species MS<SUP>-</SUP> suggest that biological productivity in the Ross Sea polynya was ~80% higher prior to 1875 AD than at any subsequent time. We propose that cooler Antarctic temperatures promoted stronger katabatic winds across the Ross Ice Shelf, resulting in an enlarged Ross Sea polynya during the LIA.",

      "abstract": "The concept of local scaling has proven to be a useful tool for the description of turbulence structures in the stable boundary layer (SBL) in mid-latitudes. In the present paper, local similarity properties of the continuously turbulent SBL over the Greenland ice sheet are investigated. The observations were obtained during the aircraft-based experiment KABEG (Katabatic wind and Boundary-layer front Experiment around Greenland) under conditions of strong katabatic winds. For the first time, this dataset allows the study of the turbulence structure in the katabatic wind system over the whole boundary layer and over a horizontal scale of 80 km.Data from six flights during different synoptic conditions are summarized. In all situations, the katabatic flow was associated with alow-level jet, and maximum wind speeds exceed20 m s-1 in several cases. The strong katabatic winds over the Greenland ice sheet represent conditions of the fully turbulent SBL under strong baroclinicity. Almost all data were collected above the surface layer and can be attributed to the regions of local scaling orz-less scaling. The local scaling concept was found to be valid also for these strong katabatic wind conditions. Profiles of scaled variances and fluxes agree with mid-latitude results, except for the total momentum flux. For the similarity functions and eddy diffusivities of the sensible heat flux, the use of the buoyancy length scale is found to be superior compared to the local Obukhov length.",

      "abstract": "Numerical simulations and surface-based observations show that katabatic winds persistently converge toward and blow across the Siple Coast part of West Antarctica onto the Ross Ice Shelf. About 14% of the time during winter (April to August 1988), thermal infrared satellite images reveal the horizontal propagation of this negatively buoyant katabatic airstream for about 1000 km across the ice shelf to its northwestern edge, a trajectory that nearly parallels the Transantarctic Mountains. This takes place when the pressure field supports such airflow, and is caused by synoptic scale cyclones that decay near and/or over Marie Byrd Land. The northwestward propagation of the katabatic winds is accompanied by other changes in the hemispheric long wave pattern. An upper level ridge develops over Wilkes Land, resulting in an enhancement of the split jet in the Pacific Ocean. Then, more frequent and/or intensified synoptic scale cyclones are steered toward Marie Byrd Land where they become nearly stationary to the northeast of the climatological location. The resulting isobaric configuration accelerates the katabatic winds crossing Siple Coast and supports their horizontal propagation across the Ross Ice Shelf. An immediate impact of this katabatic airflow, that crosses from the ice shelf to the Ross Sea, is expansion of the persistent polynya that is present just to the east of Ross Island. This polynya is a conspicuous feature on passive microwave images of Antarctic sea ice and plays a central role in the salt budget of water masses over the Ross Sea continental shelf. The impact of this katabatic airflow upon mesoscale cyclogenesis over the South Pacific Ocean is also discussed.",

It has long been believed that the Terra Nova Bay polynya opens in response to strong offshore katabatic wind forcing. This study shows that the sensible and longwave heat fluxes share equally in controlling polynya extent fluctuations, and together, these two terms in the energy budget can explain up to ~50% of the observed variance in open water fraction. Moreover, this study shows that the wind speed becomes important to the polynya dynamics through amplification of the longwave flux. Finally, this study suggests that local katabatic winds at Terra Nova Bay combined with regional ice conditions set up by winds blowing across the Ross Ice Shelf control the fluctuations in Terra Nova Bay polynya extent.",

During the nonsummer months, persistent and often times intense katabatic winds occur in the lowest few hundred meters of the Antarctic atmosphere. These slope flows transport significant amounts of cold air northward and thereby modify the horizontal pressure field over the high southern latitudes. Three-year seasonal cycle numerical simulations using the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM1) with and without representation of the Antarctic orography were performed to explore the role of the elevated terrain and drainage flows on the distribution and evolution of the horizontal pressure field. The katabatic wind regime is an important part of a clearly defined mean meridional circulation in the high southern latitudes. The position and intensity of the attendant sea level low pressure belt appears to be tied to the Antarctic orography. The seasonal movement of mass in the high southern latitudes is therefore constrained by the presence of the Antarctic ice sheet. The semiannual oscillation of pressure over Antarctica and the high southern latitudes is well depicted in the CCMI only when the Antarctic orography is included.",

Modelled ozone concentrations for the year 2001 are evaluated. The models reproduce the main features of the ozone diurnal cycle, but generally overestimate daytime ozone. LOTOS-EUROS and RCG have a more pronounced diurnal cycle variation than observations, while the reverse occurs for TM5. CHIMERE has a large positive bias, which can be explained by a systematic bias in boundary conditions. The other models and the \"ensemble model\", whose concentrations are by definition averaged over all models, represent accurately the diurnal cycle. The ability of the models to simulate day-to-day daily ozone average or maxima variability is examined by means of percentiles, root mean square errors and correlations. In general, daily maxima are better simulated than daily averages, and summertime concentrations are better simulated than wintertime concentrations. Summertime correlations range between 0.5 and 0.7 for daily averages and 0.6 and 0.8 for daily maxima. Two health-related indicators are used, the number of days of exceedance of the 120μgm<SUP>-3</SUP> threshold for the daily maximal 8-h ozone concentration and the SOMO35. Both are well reproduced in terms of frequency, but the simultaneity of occurrence of exceedance days between observations and simulations is not well captured. The advantage of using an ensemble of models instead of a single model for the assessment of air quality is demonstrated. The ensemble average concentrations almost always exhibit a closer proximity to observations than any of the models. We also show that the spread of the model ensemble is fairly representative of the uncertainty in the simulations.",

Dynamics of the phytoplankton bloom in Terra Nova Bay differed from those in the Ross Sea owing to spatial differences in katabatic wind fields which determine when the surface waters stratify. Interannual variation in the timing of formation of the Ross Sea polynya appears to be controlled by winter temperatures, which determine sea ice thickness and integrity, rather than variability or intensity in wind stress. Together, CZCS, AWS, and passive microwave data suggest that when the Ross Sea polynya forms early, stronger and more frequent katabatic winds result in increased advective losses of phytoplankton in surface waters and a delay in the phytoplankton bloom. If polynya formation is delayed until after the winds diminish in frequency, the phytoplankton bloom will develop earlier. The observation that diatoms dominate both the marginal ice zone and Terra Nova Bay, which are hydrographically similar, while Phaeocystis antarctica is found in unstable waters north of the Ross Ice Shelf, suggests that stratification plays an important role in determining species composition in the Ross Sea.",

      "abstract": "Automatic weather station (AWS) units have been deployed in Antarctica since 1980 by the U.S. Antarctic Research Program. As of June 1987, 25 AWS units are operating in Antarctica in support of meteorological research. The AWS units measure air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction at a nominal height of 3 m above the surface and air pressure at the height of the electronics enclosure. Some AWS units measure relative humidity at 3 m and air temperature difference between 3 m and 0.5 m above the surface. Three to five values for each sensor are updated at 10-min intervals and transmitted at 200-s intervals to data collection systems on the NOAA series of polar-orbiting satellites. The AWS units in Antarctica are sited to support research on katabatic winds, barrier winds, surface heat fluxes, and climate. Results from the katabatic wind experiment along a line upslope from the Adelie Coast show that the katabatic wind is stronger in winter than in summer and is strongest inland from the coast. The potential temperature difference from the south pole to the Adelie Coast has the largest negative value in winter, supporting the stronger katabatic winds. The katabatic flow down the glaciers of the Transantarctic Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf requires synoptic support because the potential temperatures on the Ross Ice Shelf are lower than at higher elevations such as the south pole. Data from AWS sites on the Ross Ice Shelf along the Transantarctic Mountains generally have southerly monthly resultant wind directions along the mountains. Ross Island with its 3000-m-high volcanoes deflects the southerly wind flow, resulting in an easterly wind direction at McMurdo Station. AWS units equipped to measure vertical air temperature difference and relative humidity provide estimates of the latent and sensible heat flux on the Ross Ice Shelf. Generally, the sensible heat flux is negative, and the latent heat flux is small. The collection of the AWS data by a local user terminal at McMurdo Station makes possible the use of the AWS data to support air operations.",

Observational data suggest that katabatic wind from Mt. Everest was ``pumping down'' ozone-rich air from the upper troposphere. Numerical modelling demonstrates that cooling of glaciers and snow on the northern mountain slopes and heating of the valley surface play important roles in forming katabatic winds and accelerating vertical exchange between the upper atmosphere and surface air. These results suggest that the ``pump-down'' mechanism at high mountains covered with snow/glaciers is an important process in terrestrial intercontinental transport of ozone and atmosphere-land exchanges of masses and energy.",

These atmospheric processes can result in changes in production rates of cosmogenic nuclides which, when integrated over long exposure durations may result in 0% to &gt;5% adjustments in site production rates depending on location. Combining a CCM3 model with imbedded ice sheets for 20 ka, we show that production rates changes (relative to today) are greatest at high elevations (6-7% at 5 km altitude) due to atmospheric compression from decreased temperature. Production rates at specific times for sites near ice sheet margins can be reduced more than 10% due to a combination of katabatic winds draining off the ice sheet margins and atmospheric cooling. Nunatak settings may be significantly affected by the climate effect due to persistent glacial atmospheric conditions. Atmospheric variability may explain some of the disparities among cosmogenic nuclide production rate calibrations.",

Atmospheric Environment] is designed to evaluate the air quality response of several emission abatement scenarios for 2010 at the scale of the European continent, and specifically in the areas where most people live: the cities. Before evaluating this response, the model simulations in a control case must be evaluated against observations in order to understand their main strengths and weaknesses. In this article six different models are used to simulate a full year (1999) of air quality pollutant concentrations over domains encompassing a large area around four major European cities: Berlin, Milan, Paris and Prague. Three models are used both at large-scale (typically 50 km) and small-scale resolution (5 km). The intercomparison of the simulation results for ozone and particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10) leads to the following conclusions: Models capture fairly well the mean, daily maxima and variability of ozone concentrations, as well as the time and intercity variability. However, a significant overestimation of ozone in city centres is found especially for large-scale models. <P />PM10 simulation skill is generally poor, and large-scale models underestimate their mass. The difference between Milan (highly polluted) and the other cities is not reproduced. All models have difficulties in capturing the observed seasonal variations. <P />The fine scale models show higher PM10 and lower ozone concentrations in urban areas, which are closer to the observations than are the large-scale models.",

The traverse area is characterised by high mountains that obstruct the ice flow, resulting in a sudden transition from the polar plateau to the coastal region. The spatial variations of potential temperature, near-surface firn density and accumulation suggest that katabatic winds are active in this region. Proxy wind data derived from firn-density profiles confirm that annual mean wind speed is strongly related to the magnitude of the surface slope. The high elevation of the ice sheet south of the mountains makes for a dry, cold climate, in which mass loss owing to sublimation is small and erosion of snow by the wind has a potentially large impact on the surface mass balance. A simple katabatic-wind model is used to explain the variations of accumulation along the traverse line in terms of divergence/convergence of the local transport of drifting snow. The resulting wind- and snowdrift patterns are closely connected to the topography of the ice sheet: ridges are especially sensitive to erosion, while ice streams and other depressions act as collectors of drifting snow.",

In the context of the Clean Air For Europe programme of the European Commission, the CityDelta project was designed to evaluate the impact of emission-reduction strategies on air quality at the European continental scale and in European cities. Ozone and particulate matter (PM) are the main components that have been studied. To achieve this goal, a model intercomparison study was organized with the participation of more than 20 modelling groups with a large number of modelling configurations. Two following main topics can be identified in the project. First, in order to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, the participating models were evaluated against observations in a control year (1999). An accompanying paper will discuss in detail this evaluation aspect for four European cities. The second topic is the actual evaluation of the impact of emission reductions on levels of ozone and PM, with particular attention to the differences between large-scale and fine-scale models. An accompanying paper will discuss this point in detail. In this overview paper the main input to the intercomparison is described as well as the use of the ensemble approach. Finally, attention is given to the policy relevant issue on how to implement the urban air quality signal into large-scale air quality models through the use of functional relationships.",

      "abstract": "One of the key components of Antarctica's harsh climate is its renowned katabatic winds, which are among the fiercest surface winds on Earth. Caused primarily by strong surface cooling over the sloping ice surface, these semipermanent winds result primarily from the strong surface temperature inversion and associated temperature deficit between the surface layer and the free atmosphere aloft. Katabatic winds exert a strong effect on the mass budget of the Antarctic ice sheet by affecting snowdrift (sublimation) and by (partially) regulating the net atmospheric moisture transports toward the Antarctic. It has been suggested that greenhouse warming may lead to reduced surface cooling and weakened katabatic winds. This is tested by using a global climate model (EC-Earth) in prescribed sea surface temperature simulations of the present-day (2002-2006) and future (2094-2098) climates. Because simulated topographically induced katabatic winds are likely to depend on the model grid, we employ two model resolutions: (1) T159L62 ( 100 km, 62 vertical levels) and (2) T799L91 ( 20 km, 91 vertical levels). It is shown here that present-day surface winds over Antarctica in high resolution are generally stronger than in low resolution, especially in the escarpment region with its steep orography. Simulated surface winds are generally underestimated with respect to observations, in particular the strongest winds (occurring over steep slopes), and especially in low resolution. The seasonal cycle in surface winds is simulated fairly accurately. Surface temperatures are also relatively well simulated (when corrected for elevation differences), especially in high resolution.",

Downward shortwave and longwave radiation were the two primary energy sources during summer days with seasonal means of 346 and 142 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. The turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat flux represent smaller heat sources. In the annual mean, reflected shortwave radiation exceeds the upward longwave radiation with a seasonal average values of -287 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. During winter, the shortwave radiation is small, and the main energy input and output terms of the surface energy balance are downward and upward longwave radiation, with seasonal average values of 149 and -159 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>, respectively. The combination of high wind speed and a large near-surface humidity gradient during summer resulted in significant frost depositional events. The total surface frost deposition for the whole year was 24 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP>, which accounted for 61% of the total accumulation (averaged over 10 years). When a high-pressure ridge blocks cyclones and deflects fronts of low-pressure systems to inland East Antarctica during winter, this has a significant impact on the surface energy balance at Panda 1 automatic weather station, with daily sensible and latent heat fluxes increasing by as much as 25 and 12 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>, respectively. These results still contain uncertainties as we only address a single year, when interannual variability may be considerable, and we do not consider drifting snow sublimation.",

The model was evaluated in Part 1 of this paper. <BR /><BR /> The near-surface temperature over the ice sheet is affected by surface elevation, latitude, longitude, large-scale and small-scale advection, occurrence of summer melt and mesoscale topographical features. The atmospheric boundary layer is characterised by a strong temperature inversion, due to continuous longwave cooling of the surface. In combination with a gently sloping surface the radiative loss maintains a persistent katabatic wind. This radiative heat loss is mainly balanced by turbulent sensible heat transport towards the surface. In summer, the surface is near radiative balance, resulting in lower wind speeds. Absorption of shortwave radiation and a positive subsurface heat flux due to refreezing melt water are heat sources for surface sublimation and melt. <BR /><BR /> The strongest temperature deficits (&gt;13 °C) are found on the northeastern slopes, where the strongest katabatic winds (&gt;9 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and lowest relative humidity (&lt;65%) occur. Due to strong large scale winds, clear sky (cloud cover &lt;0.5) and a concave surface, a continuous supply of cold dry air is generated, which enhances the katabatic forcing and suppresses subsidence of potentially warmer free atmosphere air.",

The active fire product, based on the 750 m moderate resolution \"M\" bands of VIIRS, is one of the standard operational products generated by the Interface Data Processing Segment of the S-NPP ground system. The product builds on an earlier \"Collection 4\" version of the algorithm used for processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Following postlaunch quality assessments and corrections in the input VIIRS Sensor Data Record data processing, an initial low detection bias was removed and the product achieved Beta quality in April 2012. Daily spurious detections along-scan lines were also significantly reduced as a result of further processing improvements in October 2012. Direct product comparison with MODIS over 4 months of data in 2013 has shown that VIIRS produces approximately 26% more detections than MODIS within the central 3 pixel VIIRS aggregation zone of approximately ±31° scan angle range and 70% more detections outside of that zone, mainly as a result of the superior VIIRS scanning and sampling characteristics. Further development is in progress to ensure high-quality VIIRS fire products that continue the MODIS data record and better serve the user community by delivering a full image classification product and fire radiative power retrievals. Research is also underway to take advantage of the radiometric signal from the 375 m VIIRS imager \"I\" bands.",

The AWSs are situated on the ice shelf, in the coastal/inland katabatic wind zone and on the interior plateau in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Sensible heat flux (SHF) is calculated using the aerodynamic bulk method between a single AWS sensor level and the surface, in combination with surface temperature derived from upwelling longwave radiation and surface roughness derived from eddy correlation measurements. Good agreement is found between calculated and directly measured SHF. All AWS sites show a downward-directed average sensible heat transport, but otherwise the differences between the various zones are large. The surface roughness for momentum differs by an order of magnitude between the interior plateau (0.02 mm) and the katabatic wind zone (0.16 mm). On the ice shelf, frequent clouds limit surface cooling, and annual mean SHF is small (8 W m-2). In contrast, clear skies prevail on the interior plateau, but weak winds, an aerodynamically smooth surface and stability effects limit annual mean SHF to an equally low value (8 W m-2). The most favourable conditions for sensible heat exchange are found in the katabatic wind zone, where a combination of strong winds, relatively little cloud cover and a rougher surface results in annual mean SHF values of 22 to 24 W m-2.",

The present work extends this study by investigating those effects for a wide range of stratifications and slope angles, through numerical simulations for a deep valley. The two oscillatory systems are reproduced in the simulations. The frequency of the oscillations of the katabatic winds is found to be equal to times the sine of the maximum slope angle. Remarkably, the IGW frequency is found to also vary as , with in the range -. These values for are similar to those reported for IGWs radiated by any turbulent field with no dominant frequency component.

Meteorology is generated by the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, nudged every six hours with reanalysis data. We focus on SE England, where hourly average O<SUB>3</SUB> reached up to 140 ppb during the heat-wave. EMEP4UK accurately reproduces elevated O<SUB>3</SUB> and much of its day-to-day variability during the heat-wave. Key O<SUB>3</SUB> precursors, nitrogen dioxide and isoprene, are less well simulated, but show generally accurate diurnal cycles and concentrations to within a factor of ~2-3 of observations. The modelled surface O<SUB>3</SUB> distribution has an intricate spatio-temporal structure, governed by a combination of meteorology, emissions and photochemistry. A series of sensitivity runs with the model are used to explore the factors that influenced O<SUB>3</SUB> levels during the heat-wave. Various factors appear to be important on different days and at different sites. Ozone imported from outside the model domain, especially the south, is very important on several days during the heat-wave, contributing up to 85 ppb. The effect of dry deposition is also important on several days. Modelled isoprene concentrations are generally best simulated if isoprene emissions are changed from the base emissions: typically doubled, but elevated by up to a factor of five on one hot day. We found that accurate modelling of the exact positions of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound plumes is crucial for the successful simulation of O<SUB>3</SUB> at a particular time and location. Variations in temperature of ±5 K were found to have impacts on O<SUB>3</SUB> of typically less than ±10 ppb.",

      "abstract": "Altermagnets are an emerging elementary class of collinear magnets. Unlike ferromagnets, their distinct crystal symmetries inhibit magnetization while, unlike antiferromagnets, they promote strong spin polarization in the band structure. The corresponding unconventional mechanism of time-reversal symmetry breaking without magnetization in the electronic spectra has been regarded as a primary signature of altermagnetism but has not been experimentally visualized to date. We directly observe strong time-reversal symmetry breaking in the band structure of altermagnetic RuO 2 by detecting magnetic circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoemission spectra. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio calculations, establish the microscopic electronic structure basis for a family of interesting phenomena and functionalities in fields ranging from topological matter to spintronics, which are based on the unconventional time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnets. Time-of-flight momentum microscopy reveals unconventional time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnets.",

      "abstract": "Temperature data from three Automatic Weather Stations and twelve Temperature Loggers are used to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of temperature over a glacier, its main atmospheric controls, the suitability of extrapolation techniques and their effect on melt modeling. We use data collected on Juncal Norte Glacier, central Chile, during one ablation season. We examine temporal and spatial variability in lapse rates (LRs), together with alternative statistical interpolation methods. The main control over the glacier thermal regime is the development of a katabatic boundary layer (KBL). Katabatic wind occurs at night and in the morning and is eroded in the afternoon. LRs reveal strong diurnal variability, with steeper LRs during the day when the katabatic wind weakens and shallower LRs during the night and morning. We suggest that temporally variable LRs should be used to account for the observed change. They tend to be steeper than equivalent constant LRs, and therefore result in a reduction in simulated melt compared to use of constant LRs when extrapolating from lower to higher elevations. In addition to the temporal variability, the temperature-elevation relationship varies also in space. Differences are evident between local LRs and including such variability in melt modeling affects melt simulations. Extrapolation methods based on the spatial variability of the observations after removal of the elevation trend, such as Inverse Distance Weighting or Kriging, do not seem necessary for simulations of gridded temperature data over a glacier.",

Distinct differences were found between the moisture climates of the high plateau, the katabatic wind zone and the coastal ice shelves: significant undersaturation occurs year-round in the katabatic wind zone, while on the high plateau and on the coastal ice shelf the air is usually close to saturation. In summer, absorption of shortwave radiation at the snow surface enhances surface sublimation at all sites, removing 3-9% of the annual solid precipitation. Significant summer melting is an equally important ablation term near the coast, but vanishes inland. Vertically integrated column drifting-snow sublimation was estimated using two different methods. This process appears to be similar to or greater in magnitude than surface sublimation. Because intervals between significant precipitation events may last as long as several months, sublimation and melt cause extended periods of surface ablation in summer. In summer, all ablation processes together remove 15-56% of the solid precipitation, or 6-27% on an annual basis.",

Members of the party lived under the most primitive conditions, enduring more than seven months of strong, persistent winds. The western part of Terra Nova Bay remained largely free of ice in 1912, thus preventing the group from leaving until there was sufficient daylight to cross the Drygalski Ice Tongue. This open water, however, may also have assured their survival for it attracted enough seals and penguins to provide them with a continual though limited supply of food. Despite these adverse conditions some of the men, Raymond Priestley in particular, kept detailed journals which provide the only in situwintertime observations for this area. Analysis of Priestley's wind and ice record provides strong confirmation of our model for the wintertime persistence of open water (a polynya) in Terra Nova Bay.",

      "abstract": "Previous work has shown that frequent mesoscale cyclogenesis adjacent to Franklin Island is linked to the strong and persistent katabatic winds from East Antarctica which funnel into Terra Nova Bay and then blow out over the southwestern Ross Sea. Four mesoscale cyclones that formed near Terra Nova Bay between February 16 and 20, 1988 are examined to more clearly define the governing mechanisms. These events are investigated using all available observations, including automatic weather station data, high-resolution satellite images, satellite soundings, and hemispheric synoptic analyses. The first two cyclones formed on low-level baroclinic zones established by the synoptic scale advection of warm moist air toward the cold continental air blowing gently from East Antarctica. In the second case, baroclinic instability of this small-scale cold front was apparently triggered by the enhanced upward vertical motion associated with the approach of a midtropospheric trough. The third mesocyclone formed shortly after on a baroclinic zone over the polar plateau; the second vortex completely disrupted the usual katabatic drainage over the plateau and forced warm moist air over the coastal slopes. All three cyclones moved to the north in the prevailing cyclonic flow, but the plateau vortex lasted for only 6 hours. The fourth mesoscale low formed in conjunction with an abrupt and intense surge of katabatic air from Terra Nova Bay which resharpened the coastal baroclinic zone. At the same time a transiting midtropospheric trough probably associated with lower tropospheric upward vertical motion apparently accelerated the katabatic winds and triggered the vortex formation. A similar katabatic wind-forced mesocyclone formed near Byrd Glacier. The two vortices moved to the east-southeast and northeast, respectively, apparently being steered by the generating katabatic airstreams, and merged just to the north of the Ross Ice Shelf. The combined vortex reintensified as another trough passed overhead and moved eastward to West Antarctica where it dissipated two days later.",

Here, we report reproducible charge transport in guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA molecules adsorbed on a mica substrate. Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100 pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100 nm. Our experimental results, combined with theoretical modelling, suggest that transport occurs via a thermally activated long-range hopping between multi-tetrad segments of DNA. These results could re-ignite interest in DNA-based wires and devices, and in the use of such systems in the development of programmable circuits.",

The analysis is based on flood damage data that were collected by damage experts and consist of large sample sizes within each municipality. The most interesting aspect of these two floods is that although the volume of flooding and the inundated area were comparable in order of magnitude, the flood damage estimates in 1995 were 35% lower than in 1993. We conclude that part of the reduction in flood damage during the 1995 flood was due to a reduction in the damage to household goods. This may be explained by a marginal increase in flood warning time and experiences gained from the flood of 1993. As flood damage assessments are the cornerstone in the evaluation of flood damage mitigation schemes, empirical data of previous floods should be used to improve the foundations of the methods to assess flood damages.",

We use data of automatic weather stations (AWS) located in four major Antarctic climate zones: the coastal ice shelf, the coastal and interior katabatic wind zone and the interior plateau. Absorbed short wave radiation drives the daily cycle of the SEB, in spite of the high surface albedo (0.84-0.88). The dominant heat sink is the cooling by long wave radiation, but this flux is distributed more evenly throughout the day so that a pronounced daily cycle in net all-wave radiation remains with all-sky night-time heat losses of 20-30 W m-2 and noontime heat gains of 30-40 W m-2. During the night, heat is re-supplied to the snow surface by the sensible heat flux, especially in the katabatic wind zone, and the sub-surface heat flux. Daytime radiative energy excess is removed from the surface by sublimation (except at the high plateau) and sub-surface heat transport. Daytime convection occurs at all sites around solar noon but is generally weak. Spatial differences in the SEB are largely controlled by differences in cloud cover. Clouds are associated with higher surface temperatures and near-surface wind speeds. This especially limits nocturnal cooling, so that the strongest daytime convection is found during overcast conditions on the interior plateau.",

      "abstract": "The flow structure on a gentle slope at Vallon d’Ol in the northern suburbs of Marseille in southern France has been documented by means of surface wind and temperature measurements collected from 7 June to 14 July 2001 during the ESCOMPTE experiment. The analysis of the time series reveals temperature and wind speed oscillations during several nights (about 60--90 min oscillation period) and several days (about 120-180 min oscillation period) during the whole observing period. Oscillating katabatic winds have been reported in the literature from theoretical, experimental and numerical studies. In the present study, the dynamics of the observed oscillating katabatic winds are in good agreement with the theory.In contrast to katabatic winds, no daytime observations of oscillating anabatic upslope flows have ever been published to our knowledge, probably because of temperature inversion break-up that inhibits upslope winds. The present paper shows that cold air advection by a sea breeze generates a mesoscale horizontal temperature gradient, and hence baroclinicity in the atmosphere, which then allows low-frequency oscillations, similar to a katabatic flow. An expression for the oscillation period is derived that accounts for the contribution of the sea-breeze induced mesoscale horizontal temperature gradient. The theoretical prediction of the oscillation period is compared to the measurements, and good agreement is found. The statistical analysis of the wind flow at Vallon d’Ol shows a dominant north-easterly to easterly flow pattern for nighttime oscillations and a dominant south-westerly flow pattern for daytime oscillations. These results are consistent with published numerical simulation results that show that the air drains off the mountain along the maximum slope direction, which in the studied case is oriented south-west to north-east.",

The fast energy relaxation within 500 fs is independent of the relation between level spacing and LO-phonon energy and shows no bottleneck effect. The population dynamics is mainly governed by the hole relaxation process. With increasing intensity, the formation of two-pair states (biexcitons) of various energies dominates the population dynamics due to the strong influence of Coulomb interaction in quantum dots even in the strong confinement. At high pair densities, the created two-pair states mediate a new relaxation path due to their stimulated decay into one photon and one electron-hole pair with lower energy.",

A comparison is made with results for GaAs accumulation layers. The conductance oscillates by as much as a factor of 100 and is accurately periodic in the number of electrons per unit length. The period varies randomly from sample to sample, and changes when a single sample is warmed to room temperature and remeasured at low temperature. Multiple periods are often observed, and the amplitude of the individual frequency components can be altered by moving the electron gas from side to side with a transverse electric field. These observations suggest that the period is determined by the distance between charged defects near the 1D channel. Measurements of the temperature dependence indicate that the oscillatory conductance reflects a periodic energy for a thermally activated conductance mechanism as well as a parallel oscillatory tunneling mechanism. The period of the conductance oscillations is found to be surprisingly independent of magnetic field B. However, the random modulation of the amplitude of the oscillations is reduced by a B field normal to the semiconductor surface, as it is by increasing temperature.",

Anthropogenic emissions for the years 2005 and 2050 were used for simulations of both present and future periods in order to isolate the impact of climate change, hemispheric boundary conditions and emissions, and to assess the robustness of the results across the different models. <BR /><BR /> The results from these four CTMs clearly show that the main driver of future N-deposition changes is the specified emission change. Under the specified emission scenario for 2050, emissions of oxidised nitrogen were reduced substantially, whereas emissions of NH<SUB>3</SUB> increase to some extent, and these changes are largely reflected in the modelled concentrations and depositions. The lack of sulfur and oxidised nitrogen in the future atmosphere results in a much larger fraction of NH<SUB>x</SUB> being present in the form of gaseous ammonia. <BR /><BR /> Predictions for wet and total deposition were broadly consistent, although the three fine-scale models resolve European emission areas and changes better than the hemispheric-scale model. The biggest difference in the models is for predictions of individual N compounds. One model (EMEP) was used to explore changes in critical loads, also in conjunction with speculative climate-induced increases in NH<SUB>3</SUB> emissions. These calculations suggest that the area of ecosystems that exceeds critical loads is reduced from 64% for year 2005 emissions levels to 50% for currently estimated 2050 levels. A possible climate-induced increase in NH<SUB>3</SUB> emissions could worsen the situation, with areas exceeded increasing again to 57% (for a 30% NH<SUB>3</SUB> emission increase).",

Until this knowledge gap is filled, a reliable projection of the future changes in the Himalayan glaciers is hardly possible. Here, we describe the drying effect of the katabatic winds on the up-valley summer monsoon flows by creating favorable conditions for local convergence-induced precipitation to occur near the glacier fronts. We postulate that this retarding effect on the up-valley monsoon flows results in a negative feedback mechanism mediated by glacier-air interactions, in which glacial retreat pushes precipitation upwards as the down-valley katabatic winds weaken, resulting in greater local precipitation and enhanced snow accumulation across the upper parts of the Himalayan glaciers. Our analyses are based on the exclusive data recorded in the Khumbu valley and the Langtang valley in the Nepalese Himalayas. These data revealed higher afternoon precipitation in summer associated with surface wind convergence near the glacier fronts and a sharp decrease in the temperature lapse rate over the glacier surfaces. The principle of the observed phenomena was proven by our high-resolution modeling sensitive experiment, which involved two simulations, one with the present glaciers and the other without. This numerical experiment also supports the proposed negative feedback. Furthermore, we report a low deuterium excess near the glacier fronts, indicating below-cloud re-evaporation facilitated by the local convergence induced by the dry katabatic winds. Our study suggests that current models may overestimate the retreat of Himalayan glaciers because they have completely ignored the glacier-air interactions.",

      "abstract": "A preliminary simulation of the Terra Nova Bay polynya has been performed with a coupled atmosphere-polynya model. The atmospheric model is a hydrostatic primitive equations model that has been validated previously by a simulation of the strong katabatic winds observed in that area. The polynya model includes a representation of the free drift of frazil ice and simple sea-ice dynamics and thermodynamics. Two and three-dimensional experiments have been performed under polar night conditions. Two-dimensional experiments show that an open (warm) water area influences significantly the atmospheric circulation in the antarctic coastal zone: an additional ice-breeze effect is simulated and is responsible for the strengthening of the katabatic winds near the coast. Because of the important temperature difference between the continental air and the ice-free ocean (up to 40°C), strong surface heat fluxes are simulated over the polynya. Finally, a three-dimensional experiment has been performed. The integration domain includes Terra Nova Bay. The polynya observed in that region is well simulated. It is found that heat losses from the polynya surface are stronger than previously thought but are probably constrained by the idealized representation of frazil ice, which is assumed to be uniform in each grid box. This stresses the need for having a better knowledge of frazil ice evolution in large polynyas.",

The four AWSs are situated on an ice shelf, in the coastal and inland katabatic wind zone and the interior plateau of Dronning Maud Land. To calculate surface temperature we use a SEB closure assumption for a surface skin layer. Modelled and observed surface have a root-mean-square difference of 1.8 K at the plateau AWS (corresponding to an uncertainty in the SEB of 5Wm-2) and &lt;1 K (3Wm-2) at the other sites. The effect of wind-speed sensor freezing on the calculated SEB is discussed. At all sites the annual mean net radiation is negative and the near-surface air is on average stably stratified. Differences in the seasonal cycle of the SEB are mainly caused by the different wind climates at the AWS sites. In the katabatic wind zone, a combination of clear skies and strong winds forces a large wintertime turbulent transport of sensible heat towards the surface, which in turn enhances the longwave radiative heat loss. On the coastal ice shelf and on the plateau, strong winds are associated with overcast conditions, limiting the radiative heat loss and sensible heat exchange. During the short Antarctic summer, the net radiation becomes slightly positive at all sites. Away from the cold interior, the main compensating heat loss at the surface is sublimation. In the interior, summer temperatures are too low to allow significant sublimation to occur; here, surface heat loss is mainly due to convection.",

      "abstract": "The parameterization of the boundary layer is a challenge for regional climate models of the Arctic. In particular, the stable boundary layer (SBL) over Greenland, being the main driver for substantial katabatic winds over the slopes, is simulated differently by different regional climate models or using different parameterizations of the same model. However, verification data sets with high-resolution profiles of the katabatic wind are rare. In the present paper, detailed aircraft measurements of profiles in the katabatic wind and automatic weather station data during the experiment KABEG (Katabatic wind and boundary-layer front experiment around Greenland) in April and May 1997 are used for the verification of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM) nested in ERA-Interim reanalyses. CCLM is used in a forecast mode for the whole Arctic with 15 km resolution and is run in the standard configuration of SBL parameterization and with modified SBL parameterization. In the modified version, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production and the transfer coefficients for turbulent fluxes in the SBL are reduced, leading to higher stability of the SBL. This leads to a more realistic representation of the daily temperature cycle and of the SBL structure in terms of temperature and wind profiles for the lowest 200 m.",

      "abstract": "Radiative control of surface temperature is a key characteristic of the martian environment and its low-density atmosphere. Here we show through meteorological modeling that surface temperature can be far from radiative equilibrium over numerous sloping terrains on Mars, where nighttime mesoscale katabatic winds impact the surface energy budget. Katabatic circulations induce both adiabatic atmospheric heating and enhancement of downward sensible heat flux, which then becomes comparable to radiative flux and acts to warm the ground. Through this mechanism, surface temperature can increase up to 20 K. One consequence is that warm signatures of surface temperature over slopes, observed through infrared spectrometry, cannot be systematically associated with contrasts of intrinsic soil thermal inertia. Apparent thermal inertia maps retrieved thus far possibly contain wind-induced structures. Another consequence is that surface temperature observations close to sloping terrains could allow the validation of model predictions for martian katabatic winds, provided contrasts in intrinsic thermal inertia can be ruled out. The thermal impact of winds is mostly discussed in this paper in the particular cases of Olympus Mons/Lycus Sulci and Terra Meridiani but is generally significant over any sloped terrains in low thermal inertia areas. It is even general enough to apply under daytime conditions, thereby providing a possible explanation for observed afternoon surface cooling, and to ice-covered terrains, thereby providing new insights on how winds could have shaped the present surface of Mars.",

      "abstract": "Despite its importance as one of the key radiative properties that determines the impact of upper tropospheric clouds on the radiation balance, ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) has proven to be one of the more challenging properties to retrieve from space-based remote sensing measurements. In particular, optically thin upper tropospheric ice clouds (cirrus) have been especially challenging due to their tenuous nature, extensive spatial scales, and complex particle shapes and light-scattering characteristics. The lack of independent validation motivates the investigation presented in this paper, wherein systematic biases between MODIS Collection 5 (C5) and CALIOP Version 3 (V3) unconstrained retrievals of tenuous IOT (&lt; 3) are examined using a month of collocated A-Train observations. An initial comparison revealed a factor of 2 bias between the MODIS and CALIOP IOT retrievals. This bias is investigated using an infrared (IR) radiative closure approach that compares both products with MODIS IR cirrus retrievals developed for this assessment. The analysis finds that both the MODIS C5 and the unconstrained CALIOP V3 retrievals are biased (high and low, respectively) relative to the IR IOT retrievals. Based on this finding, the MODIS and CALIOP algorithms are investigated with the goal of explaining and minimizing the biases relative to the IR. For MODIS we find that the assumed ice single-scattering properties used for the C5 retrievals are not consistent with the mean IR COT distribution. The C5 ice scattering database results in the asymmetry parameter (g) varying as a function of effective radius with mean values that are too large. The MODIS retrievals have been brought into agreement with the IR by adopting a new ice scattering model for Collection 6 (C6) consisting of a modified gamma distribution comprised of a single habit (severely roughened aggregated columns); the C6 ice cloud optical property models have a constant g ≈ 0.75 in the mid-visible spectrum, 5-15 % smaller than C5. For CALIOP, the assumed lidar ratio for unconstrained retrievals is fixed at 25 sr for the V3 data products. This value is found to be inconsistent with the constrained (predominantly nighttime) CALIOP retrievals. An experimental data set was produced using a modified lidar ratio of 32 sr for the unconstrained retrievals (an increase of 28 %), selected to provide consistency with the constrained V3 results. These modifications greatly improve the agreement with the IR and provide consistency between the MODIS and CALIOP products. Based on these results the recently released MODIS C6 optical products use the single-habit distribution given above, while the upcoming CALIOP V4 unconstrained algorithm will use higher lidar ratios for unconstrained retrievals.",

Anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors from RCP4.5 for year 2000 were used for simulations of both present and future periods in order to isolate the impact of climate change and to assess the robustness of the results across the different models. The sensitivity of the simulated surface ozone to changes in climate between the periods 2000-2009 and 2040-2049 differs by a factor of two between the models, but the general pattern of change with an increase in southern Europe is similar across different models. Emissions of isoprene differ substantially between different CTMs ranging from 1.6 to 8.0 Tg yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for the current climate, partly due to differences in horizontal resolution of meteorological input data. Also the simulated change in total isoprene emissions varies substantially across models explaining part of the different climate response on surface ozone. Ensemble mean changes in summer mean ozone and mean of daily maximum ozone are close to 1 ppb(v) in parts of the land area in southern Europe. Corresponding changes of 95-percentiles of hourly ozone are close to 2 ppb(v) in the same region. In northern Europe ensemble mean for mean and daily maximum show negative changes while there are no negative changes for the higher percentiles indicating that climate impacts on O<SUB>3</SUB> could be especially important in connection with extreme summer events.",

The correction is essential because a certain amount of the forward scattered light flux is always overlaid on the transmitted radiation. Hence it enters together with the attenuated beam into the finite aperture of any detector system and therefore constitutes a potential problem in the inversion of measured data. This correction depends not only on the geometry of the measuring system but also substantially on the optical depth of the medium. We discuss the numerical analysis of the magnitude and functional behaviour of the scattering correction for a number of important measuring parameters and we give a simple approximation for the determination of the range of applicability of the scattering correction for single scattering conditions. Finally, we show that the derived expressions yield useful values of optical depths at which non-negligible multiple scattering effects occur.",

Within these projects, CITYDELTA and EURODELTA, the fate of air quality at the scale of European cities or that of the European continent was studied using several models. In this article we focus on the results of EURODELTA. The predictive skill of the ensemble of models is described for ozone, nitrogen dioxide and secondary inorganic compounds, and the uncertainty in air quality modelling is examined through the model ensemble spread of concentrations. For ozone daily maxima the ensemble spread origin differs from one region to another. In the neighbourhood of cities or in mountainous areas the spread of predicted values does not span the range of observed data, due to poorly resolved emissions or complex-terrain meteorology. By contrast in Atlantic and North Sea coastal areas the spread of predicted values is found to be larger than the observations. This is attributed to large differences in the boundary conditions used in the different models. For NO <SUB>2</SUB> daily averages the ensemble spread is generally too small compared with observations. This is because models miss highest values occurring in stagnant meteorology in stable boundary layers near cities. For secondary particulate matter compounds the simulated concentration spread is more balanced, observations falling nearly equiprobably within the ensemble, and the spread originates both from meteorology and aerosol chemistry and thermodynamics.",

In this study, two different refueling station concepts for fuel cell passenger cars with 70 MPa technology were evaluated energetically. In the first option, the input of the refueling station is gaseous hydrogen which is compressed to final pressure, remaining in gaseous state. In the second option, the input is liquid hydrogen which is cryo-compressed directly from the liquid phase to the target pressure. In the first case, the target temperature of ‑33 °C to ‑40 °C [1] is achieved by cooling down. In the second option, gaseous deep-cold hydrogen coming from the pump is heated up to target temperature. A dynamic simulation model considering real gas behavior to evaluate both types of fueling stations from an energetic perspective was created. The dynamic model allows the simulation of boil-off losses (liquid stations) and standby energy losses caused by the precooling system (gaseous station) dependent on fueling profiles. The functionality of the model was demonstrated with a sequence of three refueling processes within a short time period (high station utilization). The liquid station consumed 0.37 kWh/kg compared to 2.43 kWh/kg of the gaseous station. Rough estimations indicated that the energy consumption of the entire pathway is higher for liquid hydrogen. The analysis showed the high influence of the high-pressure storage system design on the energy consumption of the station. For future research work the refueling station model can be applied to analyze the energy consumption dependent on factors like utilization, component sizing and ambient temperature.",

      "abstract": "Air pollution causes adverse effects on human health as well as ecosystems and crop yield and also has an impact on climate change trough short-lived climate forcers. To design mitigation strategies for air pollution, 3D Chemistry Transport Models (CTMs) have been developed to support the decision process. Increases in model resolution may provide more accurate and detailed information, but will cubically increase computational costs and pose additional challenges concerning high resolution input data. The motivation for the present study was therefore to explore the impact of using finer horizontal grid resolution for policy support applications of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model within the Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) convention. The goal was to determine the \"optimum resolution\" at which additional computational efforts do not provide increased model performance using presently available input data. Five regional CTMs performed four runs for 2009 over Europe at different horizontal resolutions. <P />The models' responses to an increase in resolution are broadly consistent for all models. The largest response was found for NO<SUB>2</SUB> followed by PM<SUB>10</SUB> and O<SUB>3</SUB>. Model resolution does not impact model performance for rural background conditions. However, increasing model resolution improves the model performance at stations in and near large conglomerations. The statistical evaluation showed that the increased resolution better reproduces the spatial gradients in pollution regimes, but does not help to improve significantly the model performance for reproducing observed temporal variability. This study clearly shows that increasing model resolution is advantageous, and that leaving a resolution of 50 km in favour of a resolution between 10 and 20 km is practical and worthwhile. As about 70% of the model response to grid resolution is determined by the difference in the spatial emission distribution, improved emission allocation procedures at high spatial and temporal resolution are a crucial factor for further model resolution improvements.",

      "abstract": "During recent summers (2007-2012), several surface melt records were broken over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). The extreme summer melt resulted in part from a persistent negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), favoring warmer atmospheric conditions than normal over the GrIS. Simultaneously, large anomalies in sea ice cover (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) were observed in the North Atlantic, suggesting a possible connection. To assess the direct impact of 2007-2012 SIC and SST anomalies on GrIS surface mass balance (SMB), a set of sensitivity experiments was carried out with the regional climate model MAR forced by ERA-Interim. These simulations suggest that perturbations in SST and SIC in the seas surrounding Greenland do not considerably impact GrIS SMB, as a result of the katabatic wind blocking effect. These offshore-directed winds prevent oceanic near-surface air, influenced by SIC and SST anomalies, from penetrating far inland. Therefore, the ice sheet SMB response is restricted to coastal regions, where katabatic winds cease. A topic for further investigation is how anomalies in SIC and SST might have indirectly affected the surface melt by changing the general circulation in the North Atlantic region, hence favoring more frequent warm air advection towards the GrIS.",

In order to resolve the mineralogical composition and the regional distribution of these sediments, we processed OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral data with an original method based on spectral derivation. We find that gypsum is present in all areas where undefined hydrated minerals had been previously detected, including superficial sedimentary veneers covering the North Polar Cap, interior dune fields and the whole Circumpolar Dune Field. Morphological and structural analyses reveal that these gypsum crystals derive directly from the interior of the ice cap. The source of superficial sedimentary veneers is the dust that was previously contained in the upper part of the ice cap, the ice-rich North Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD). This gypsum-bearing dust was released, on south-facing slopes of spiral troughs and arcuate scarps, by ice ablation controlled by katabatic winds. By the analysis of all associations of erosional scarps and dune fields over the North Polar Cap, we also demonstrate that the polar dunes are composed of sand-sized particles that were previously contained in the sediment-rich Basal Unit (BU), corresponding to the lower part of the ice cap. These particles contain gypsum and were released from the BU, by regressive ablation of ice at marginal scarps that border the North Polar Cap and by vertical ablation of ice on Olympia Planum. From a reconstruction of wind streamlines over and around the ice cap, we infer that katabatic winds descending from the polar high and rotating around the North Polar Cap control the release of these gypsum-bearing particles by ice ablation and the redistribution of these particles in the Circumpolar Dune Field.",

      "abstract": "In this study, different hydrogen refueling station (HRS) architectures are analyzed energetically as well as economically for 2015 and 2050. For the energetic evaluation, the model published in Bauer et al. [1] is used and norm-fitting fuelings according to SAE J2601 [2] are applied. This model is extended to include an economic evaluation. The compressor (gaseous hydrogen) resp. pump (liquid hydrogen) throughput and maximum pressures and volumes of the cascaded high-pressure storage system vessels are dimensioned in a way to minimize lifecycle costs, including depreciation, capital commitment and electricity costs. Various station capacity sizes are derived and energy consumption is calculated for different ambient temperatures and different station utilizations. Investment costs and costs per fueling mass are calculated based on different station utilizations and an ambient temperature of +12 °C. In case of gaseous trucked-in hydrogen, a comparison between 5 MPa and 20 MPa low-pressure storage is conducted. For all station configurations and sizes, a medium-voltage grid connection is applied if the power load exceeds a certain limit. For stations with on-site production, the electric power load of the hydrogen production device (electrolyzer or gas reformer) is taken into account in terms of power load. Costs and energy consumption attributed to the production device are not considered in this study due to comparability to other station concepts. Therefore, grid connection costs are allocated to the fueling station part excluding the production device. The operational strategy of the production device is also considered as energy consumption of the subsequent compressor or pump and the required low-pressure storage are affected by it. All station concepts, liquid truck-supplied hydrogen as well as stations with gaseous truck-supplied or on-site produced hydrogen show a considerable cost reduction potential. Long-term specific hydrogen costs of large stations (6 dispensers) are 0.63 €/kg – 0.76 €/kg (dependent on configuration) for stations with gaseous stored hydrogen and 0.18 €/kg for stations with liquid stored hydrogen. The study focuses only on the refueling station and does not allow a statement about the overall cost-effectiveness of different pathways.",

In most cases, the etch rate anisotropies are well described by a simple model that is based on step-flow etching. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of etching were used to test the simple model and to generate approximate morphologies of the etched surfaces. Vicinal Si(110) surfaces display unusual, orientation-dependent etch rates in some etchants; the functional form of the etch rate anisotropy suggests that a morphological transition occurs on these highly reactive faces. In moderately concentrated KOH solutions where isopropanol is readily soluble, the measured etch rate anisotropies suggest that isopropanol stabilizes step-flow etching.",

      "abstract": "The role of clouds remains the largest uncertainty in climate projections. They influence solar and thermal radiative transfer and the earth's water cycle. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate cloud observations to validate climate models and to monitor climate change. Passive satellite imagers measuring radiation at visible to thermal infrared (IR) wavelengths provide a wealth of information on cloud properties. Among others, the cloud top height (CTH) - a crucial parameter to estimate the thermal cloud radiative forcing - can be retrieved. In this paper we investigate the skill of ten current retrieval algorithms to estimate the CTH using observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In the first part we compare ten SEVIRI cloud top pressure (CTP) data sets with each other. The SEVIRI algorithms catch the latitudinal variation of the CTP in a similar way. The agreement is better in the extratropics than in the tropics. In the tropics multi-layer clouds and thin cirrus layers complicate the CTP retrieval, whereas a good agreement among the algorithms is found for trade wind cumulus, marine stratocumulus and the optically thick cores of the deep convective system. <BR /><BR /> In the second part of the paper the SEVIRI retrievals are compared to CTH observations from the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) instruments. It is important to note that the different measurement techniques cause differences in the retrieved CTH data. SEVIRI measures a radiatively effective CTH, while the CTH of the active instruments is derived from the return time of the emitted radar or lidar signal. Therefore, some systematic differences are expected. On average the CTHs detected by the SEVIRI algorithms are 1.0 to 2.5 km lower than CALIOP observations, and the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the CALIOP data sets range between 0.77 and 0.90. The average CTHs derived by the SEVIRI algorithms are closer to the CPR measurements than to CALIOP measurements. The biases between SEVIRI and CPR retrievals range from -0.8 km to 0.6 km. The correlation coefficients of CPR and SEVIRI observations vary between 0.82 and 0.89. To discuss the origin of the CTH deviation, we investigate three cloud categories: optically thin and thick single layer as well as multi-layer clouds. For optically thick clouds the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the reference data sets are usually above 0.95. For optically thin single layer clouds the correlation coefficients are still above 0.92. For this cloud category the SEVIRI algorithms yield CTHs that are lower than CALIOP and similar to CPR observations. Most challenging are the multi-layer clouds, where the correlation coefficients are for most algorithms between 0.6 and 0.8. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the SEVIRI retrievals for boundary layer clouds. While the CTH retrieval for this cloud type is relatively accurate, there are still considerable differences between the algorithms. These are related to the uncertainties and limited vertical resolution of the assumed temperature profiles in combination with the presence of temperature inversions, which lead to ambiguities in the CTH retrieval. Alternative approaches for the CTH retrieval of low clouds are discussed.",

A cloudy pixel is usually assumed to be horizontally homogeneous in the retrieval. Ignoring subpixel variations of cloud reflectances can lead to a significant bias in the retrieved τ and r<SUB>e</SUB>. In the literature, the retrievals of τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> are often assumed to be independent and considered separately when investigating the impact of subpixel cloud reflectance variations on the bispectral method. As a result, the impact on τ is contributed only by the subpixel variation of VIS/NIR band reflectance and the impact on r<SUB>e</SUB> only by the subpixel variation of SWIR band reflectance. In our new framework, we use the Taylor expansion of a two-variable function to understand and quantify the impacts of subpixel variances of VIS/NIR and SWIR cloud reflectances and their covariance on the τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals. This framework takes into account the fact that the retrievals are determined by both VIS/NIR and SWIR band observations in a mutually dependent way. In comparison with previous studies, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of how subpixel cloud reflectance variations impact the τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals based on the bispectral method. In particular, our framework provides a mathematical explanation of how the subpixel variation in VIS/NIR band influences the r<SUB>e</SUB> retrieval and why it can sometimes outweigh the influence of variations in the SWIR band and dominate the error in r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals, leading to a potential contribution of positive bias to the r<SUB>e</SUB> retrieval. We test our framework using synthetic cloud fields from a large-eddy simulation and real observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The predicted results based on our framework agree very well with the numerical simulations. Our framework can be used to estimate the retrieval uncertainty from subpixel reflectance variations in operational satellite cloud products and to help understand the differences in τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals between two instruments.",

The atmospheric boundary layer flows over a patchy snow cover were calculated with an atmospheric model (Advanced Regional Prediction System) on a very high spatial resolution of 5 m. The numerical results revealed that the development of local flow patterns and the relative importance of boundary layer processes depend on the snow patch size distribution and the synoptic wind forcing. Energy balance calculations for quiescent wind situations demonstrated that well-developed katabatic winds exerted a major control on the energy balance over the patchy snow cover, leading to a maximum in the mean downward sensible heat flux over snow for high snow-cover fractions. This implies that if katabatic winds develop, total melt of snow patches may decrease for low snow-cover fractions despite an increasing ambient air temperature, which would not be predicted by most hydrological models. In contrast, stronger synoptic winds increased the effect of heat advection on the catchment's melt behavior by enhancing the mean sensible heat flux over snow for lower snow-cover fractions. A sensitivity analysis to grid resolution suggested that the grid size is a critical factor for modeling the energy balance of a patchy snow cover. The comparison of simulation results from coarse (50 m) and fine (5 m) horizontal resolutions revealed a difference in the spatially averaged turbulent heat flux over snow of 40%-70% for synoptic cases and 95% for quiescent cases.",

Resultant surface winds are intimately linked to the orientation of the ice terrain (Fig. 1) and display the highest degree of persistence found on Earth. The close coupling between wind and topography allows estimation of the former if the latter is known with some precision. Here we report on time-averaged, near-surface airflow over the Antarctic continent during winter diagnosed from a recent, accurate synthesis of terrain slopes and from estimates of the lower atmospheric temperature structure. The simulated drainage pat-tern exhibits strong spatial variability with the airflow concentrated into several zones near the coastal margin. These confluence regions are responsible for strong persistent katabatic winds over downstream coastal stretches and are indicative of zones of greatest katabatic potential.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports the results of a parametric CFD study on idealized city models to investigate the potential of slope flow in ventilating a city located in a mountainous region when the background synoptic wind is absent. Examples of such a city include Tokyo in Japan, Los Angeles and Phoenix in the US, and Hong Kong. Two types of buoyancy-driven flow are considered, i.e., slope flow from the mountain slope (katabatic wind at night and anabatic wind in the daytime), and wall flow due to heated/cooled urban surfaces. The combined buoyancy-driven flow system can serve the purpose of dispersing the accumulated urban air pollutants when the background wind is weak or absent. The microscopic picture of ventilation performance within the urban structures was evaluated in terms of air change rate (ACH) and age of air. The simulation results reveal that the slope flow plays an important role in ventilating the urban area, especially in calm conditions. Katabatic flow at night is conducive to mitigating the nocturnal urban heat island. In the present parametric study, the mountain slope angle and mountain height are assumed to be constant, and the changing variables are heating/cooling intensity and building height. For a typical mountain of 500 m inclined at an angle of 20° to the horizontal level, the interactive structure is very much dependent on the ratio of heating/cooling intensity as well as building height. When the building is lower than 60 m, the slope wind dominates. When the building is as high as 100 m, the contribution from the urban wall flow cannot be ignored. It is found that katabatic wind can be very beneficial to the thermal environment as well as air quality at the pedestrian level. The air change rate for the pedestrian volume can be as high as 300 ACH.",

In these polynyas, relatively warm ocean is exposed to cold, dry continental air, resulting in high sea-ice production rates. We have calculated ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes over an area of the Mertz Glacier polynya, East Antarctica, from atmospheric data collected in August 1999. Air-temperature and humidity data were measured using a probe extending from a helicopter undercarriage. Flights were made over the most vigorously ice-producing part of the polynya, within 20 km of the coast in southeast Buchanan Bay, both in very strong katabatic winds (20 m s-1) and during calmer conditions (5 m s-1). The total turbulent heat loss from the surface was nearly 575 W m-2 for the windy case and 250 W m-2 for the calmer one, with a ratio of sensible to latent heat in both cases of slightly more than four. These fluxes are in general agreement with other estimates of heat loss from Antarctic polynyas. Strong katabatic winds, sometimes exceeding 40 m s-1, were common in Buchanan Bay and the heat losses during the strong-wind cafe are probably typical of the region. We suggest that this inner part of the Mertz Glacier polynya has a very high ice-production rate.",

Water vapor concentration and isotopic ratios measured continuously over a 25 day period in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland were used to monitor the convergence of easterly katabatic winds and westerly sea breezes that form a front between the dry, isotopically depleted, glacial air mass and the moist, isotopically enriched, marine air mass. During the latter 16 days of the measurement period, an interval with no large-scale synoptic interference, the inland penetration of the sea breeze controlled the largest day-to-day humidity and vapor isotopic variations. Kangerlussuaq experienced sea breezes in the afternoon on 9 days, consistent with the long-term average of such occurrences on 56% of days in July and August. The inland position of the sea breeze front is controlled by the katabatic wind strength, which is stronger during times of reduced cloud coverage and/or higher-pressure gradient between the coast and the Greenland ice sheet. The position and movement of the front will likely respond to changes in the general atmospheric circulation and regional radiation balance resulting from global warming, which will, in turn, impact the local hydrological cycle and ecosystem processes.",

      "abstract": "Addition of sulfate resulted in complete inhibition of methanogenesis in anoxic paddy soil. About 20% of the CH 4 was produced from H 2 14 CO 2 , the rest from acetate. Inhibition of H 2-dependent methanogenesis was explained by successful competition by sulfate reducers for H 2, as the H 2 partial pressures decreased upon addition of sulfate. However, acetate concentrations did not decrease. Sulfate reduction was stimulated by H 2, but not by acetate. Counts of acetate-utilizing sulfate reducers were relatively low both in fresh and pasteurized soil indicating that the bacteria were only present as spores. Inhibition of methanogenesis by chloroform resulted in accumulation of both H 2 and acetate. When sulfate was added in addition, H 2 accumulation stopped, but acetate still accumulated indicating that the activity of the methanogens was necessary for acetate conversion and that acetate could not be utilized by the sulfate reducers directly. Conversion of [2- 14C]acetate resulted in formation of relatively more 14CO 2, when sulfate was added, indicating that the methyl group of acetate was now being oxidized instead of reduced. Addition of chloroform strongly inhibited the conversion of [2- 14C]acetate, even in the presence of sulfate. A conceivable explanation is sulfate-dependent interspecies H 2 transfer between acetate-utilizing methanogens and H 2-utilizing sulfate reducers, changing the electron flow from CH 4 production to sulfate reduction. Addition of ferrihydrite resulted only in incomplete inhibition of methanogenesis which could be explained by successful competition of ferric iron reducers for H 2. The ferric iron reducers were able to use acetate directly, but did not outcompete the methanogens.",

      "abstract": "Haywood et al. (2004) show that an aerosol layer above a cloud can cause a bias in the retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius. Monitoring for this potential bias is difficult because space-based passive remote sensing cannot unambiguously detect or characterize aerosol above cloud. We show that cloud retrievals from aircraft measurements above cloud and below an overlying aerosol layer are a means to test this bias. The data were collected during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-A) study based out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States, above extensive, marine stratus cloud banks affected by industrial outflow. Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) irradiance measurements taken along a lower level flight leg above cloud and below aerosol were unaffected by the overlying aerosol. Along upper level flight legs, the irradiance reflected from cloud top was transmitted through an aerosol layer. We compare SSFR cloud retrievals from below-aerosol legs to satellite retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to detect an aerosol-induced bias. In regions of small variation in cloud properties, we find that SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness compares within the uncertainty range for each instrument while SSFR effective radius tend to be smaller than MODIS values (by 1-2 μm) and at the low end of MODIS uncertainty estimates. In regions of large variation in cloud properties, differences in SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius can reach values of 10 and 10 μm, respectively. We include aerosols in forward modeling to test the sensitivity of SSFR cloud retrievals to overlying aerosol layers. We find an overlying absorbing aerosol layer biases SSFR cloud retrievals to smaller effective radii and optical thickness while nonabsorbing aerosols had no impact.",

Resonant inelastic light-scattering spectra reveal low-lying transitions that are not present in the unpatterned GaAs quantum well. These excitations reveal the energy dependence of the joint density of states for AG band transitions. Fermi level tuning through the Dirac point results in a collapse of the density of states at low transition energy, suggesting the emergence of the MDF linear dispersion in the AG.",

Observations include the growth of an anabatic convective boundary layer in summer, production of katabatic storm outflows moving contrary to prevailing easterlies, and detailed sequences of the wind and temperature in katabatic wind. The onset time for downslope motion is just before dawn after a clear night in summer, although observed within three hours of clear-sky conditions in winter. The delay in onset is most likely due to opposing upslope flow in summer. The vertical structure of the katabatic wind resembles that of entraining gravity flows. We make a distinction between an inner katabatic layer, near the level of wind maximum, in which the buoyancy force is large, and an entraining outer layer above, that is primarily forced by the inner layer.",

For an average day, the all wave radiation budget based on the fluxes toward the surface being positive was positive for about 11 h, which is a short time considering that the sun was above the horizon between 22 and 24 h a day during the observational period. It is a result of the high albedo, which, on average, was found to be about 83%. Furthermore, with increasing cloudiness, a more positive radiation budget was found, which is in contrast to most studies at lower latitudes. The heat flux in and out of the snow cover was small, and showed a typical sinusoidal diurnal variation. The mean daily values of snow heat flux were negative, as the snow cover was warmed during the observational period. The latent heat flux was negative, on the average, as sublimation took place for most of the time. Deposition was observed only on a few nights. The sensible heat flux was negative around noon, but positive for most of the day, which means that the air above the surface was cooled, an inversion developed, and as the surface is inclined, gravitational flow (katabatic wind) started to occur. While the all-wave radiation balance had its minimum around midnight, the minimum temperature was observed some 3 h law, and the maximum wind speed occurred about 2 additional hours later.In summary, the mean warming of the snow, the sublimation and the negative all-wave radiation budget for most of the days were compensated by a positive sensible heat flux, which explains the frequent occurrence of the katabatic wind.",

To do so, the governing budget equations are derived and presented in terms of vertically averaged quantities. Moreover, stationarity is assumed in the present study. Measurements collected during the GIMEX-91 experiment are used to calculate the contribution of the different terms in the equations to the budget. During summer, a well developed katabatic wind system is present over the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet. The budgets show that advection in the katabatic layer is small for momentum, heat and humidity, when the horizontal length scale of the integration area is sufficiently large (&gt;50 km). This indicates that in principle one-dimensional atmospheric models can be used to study the boundary layer over the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet. The background stratification plays a crucial role in the heat and moisture budget. Vertical divergence of longwave radiation provides one-third and the turbulent flux of sensible heat the rest of the cooling of the boundary layer. Moisture is added to the boundary layer by evaporation which is a significant term in the moisture budget. Negative buoyancy (katabatic forcing) dominates the momentum budget in the downslope direction. Coriolis forcing is important, stressing the large spatial scale of the katabatic winds on the Greenland ice sheet.",

Loess here is commonly 25-70 cm thick. Upland areas that were deglaciated early and remained geomorphically stable preferentially accumulated loess by providing sites that were efficient at trapping and retaining eolian sediment. Data from 419 such sites indicate that the loess was mainly derived from proglacial outwash plains and, to a lesser extent, hummocky end moraines within and near the region, particularly those toward the east of the loess deposits. Most of the loess was transported on katabatic winds coming off the ice sheet, which entrained and transported both silt and fine sands. The loess fines markedly, and is better sorted, distal to these source regions. Only minimal amounts of loess were deposited in this area via westerly winds. This research (1) reinforces the observation that outwash plains and end moraines can be significant loess sources, (2) provides evidence for katabatic winds as significant eolian transport vectors, and (3) demonstrates that the loess record may be variously preserved across landscapes, depending on where and when geomorphically stable sites became available for loess accumulation.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and intercomparison of air quality models is key to reducing model errors and uncertainty. The projects AQMEII3 and EURODELTA-Trends, in the framework of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants and the Task Force on Measurements and Modelling, respectively (both task forces under the UNECE Convention on the Long Range Transport of Air Pollution, LTRAP), have brought together various regional air quality models to analyze their performance in terms of air concentrations and wet deposition, as well as to address other specific objectives. <P />This paper jointly examines the results from both project communities by intercomparing and evaluating the deposition estimates of reduced and oxidized nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in Europe simulated by 14 air quality model systems for the year 2010. An accurate estimate of deposition is key to an accurate simulation of atmospheric concentrations. In addition, deposition fluxes are increasingly being used to estimate ecological impacts. It is therefore important to know by how much model results differ and how well they agree with observed values, at least when comparison with observations is possible, such as in the case of wet deposition. <P />This study reveals a large variability between the wet deposition estimates of the models, with some performing acceptably (according to previously defined criteria) and others underestimating wet deposition rates. For dry deposition, there are also considerable differences between the model estimates. An ensemble of the models with the best performance for N wet deposition was made and used to explore the implications of N deposition in the conservation of protected European habitats. Exceedances of empirical critical loads were calculated for the most common habitats at a resolution of 100 × 100 m<SUP>2</SUP> within the Natura 2000 network, and the habitats with the largest areas showing exceedances are determined. <P />Moreover, simulations with reduced emissions in selected source areas indicated a fairly linear relationship between reductions in emissions and changes in the deposition rates of N and S. An approximate 20 % reduction in N and S deposition in Europe is found when emissions at a global scale are reduced by the same amount. European emissions are by far the main contributor to deposition in Europe, whereas the reduction in deposition due to a decrease in emissions in North America is very small and confined to the western part of the domain. Reductions in European emissions led to substantial decreases in the protected habitat areas with critical load exceedances (halving the exceeded area for certain habitats), whereas no change was found, on average, when reducing North American emissions in terms of average values per habitat.",

      "abstract": "The implementation of European emission abatement strategies has led to a significant reduction in the emissions of ozone precursors during the last decade. Ground-level ozone is also influenced by meteorological factors such as temperature, which exhibit interannual variability and are expected to change in the future. The impacts of climate change on air quality are usually investigated through air-quality models that simulate interactions between emissions, meteorology and chemistry. Within a multi-model assessment, this study aims to better understand how air-quality models represent the relationship between meteorological variables and surface ozone concentrations over Europe. A multiple linear regression (MLR) approach is applied to observed and modelled time series across 10 European regions in springtime and summertime for the period of 2000-2010 for both models and observations. Overall, the air-quality models are in better agreement with observations in summertime than in springtime and particularly in certain regions, such as France, central Europe or eastern Europe, where local meteorological variables show a strong influence on surface ozone concentrations. Larger discrepancies are found for the southern regions, such as the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean basin, especially in springtime. We show that the air-quality models do not properly reproduce the sensitivity of surface ozone to some of the main meteorological drivers, such as maximum temperature, relative humidity and surface solar radiation. Specifically, all air-quality models show more limitations in capturing the strength of the ozone-relative-humidity relationship detected in the observed time series in most of the regions, for both seasons. Here, we speculate that dry-deposition schemes in the air-quality models might play an essential role in capturing this relationship. We further quantify the relationship between ozone and maximum temperature (m<SUB>o3-T</SUB>, climate penalty) in observations and air-quality models. In summertime, most of the air-quality models are able to reproduce the observed climate penalty reasonably well in certain regions such as France, central Europe and northern Italy. However, larger discrepancies are found in springtime, where air-quality models tend to overestimate the magnitude of the observed climate penalty.",

      "abstract": "Measurements are reported of the temperature dependence of the conductance through a small region of electron gas separated from its leads by tunnel junctions. The quantization of charge and energy in the small region gives rise to sharp, nearly periodic peaks in the conductance as a function of electron density, one for each electron added to the isolated region. Because the charge and energy are quantized, we call this an artificial atom. At low temperature, the conductance is limited by resonant tunneling through a single quantum level of the artificial atom, but at high temperatures several levels participate. Changes in the temperature dependence of the width and height of conductance peaks display clear evidence for this crossover from single-level to multilevel transport.",

      "abstract": "A multi-model study of the long-range transport of ozone and its precursors from major anthropogenic source regions was coordinated by the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP) under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Vertical profiles of ozone at 12-h intervals from 2001 are available from twelve of the models contributing to this study and are compared here with observed profiles from ozonesondes. The contributions from each major source region are analysed for selected sondes, and this analysis is supplemented by retroplume calculations using the FLEXPART Lagrangian particle dispersion model to provide insight into the origin of ozone transport events and the cause of differences between the models and observations. <BR /><BR /> In the boundary layer ozone levels are in general strongly affected by regional sources and sinks. With a considerably longer lifetime in the free troposphere, ozone here is to a much larger extent affected by processes on a larger scale such as intercontinental transport and exchange with the stratosphere. Such individual events are difficult to trace over several days or weeks of transport. This may explain why statistical relationships between models and ozonesonde measurements are far less satisfactory than shown in previous studies for surface measurements at all seasons. The lowest bias between model-calculated ozone profiles and the ozonesonde measurements is seen in the winter and autumn months. Following the increase in photochemical activity in the spring and summer months, the spread in model results increases, and the agreement between ozonesonde measurements and the individual models deteriorates further. <BR /><BR /> At selected sites calculated contributions to ozone levels in the free troposphere from intercontinental transport are shown. Intercontinental transport is identified based on differences in model calculations with unperturbed emissions and emissions reduced by 20% by region. Intercontinental transport of ozone is finally determined based on differences in model ensemble calculations. With emissions perturbed by 20% per region, calculated intercontinental contributions to ozone in the free troposphere range from less than 1 ppb to 3 ppb, with small contributions in winter. The results are corroborated by the retroplume calculations. At several locations the seasonal contributions to ozone in the free troposphere from intercontinental transport differ from what was shown earlier at the surface using the same dataset. The large spread in model results points to a need of further evaluation of the chemical and physical processes in order to improve the credibility of global model results.",

      "abstract": "The Dyatlov Pass incident is an intriguing unsolved mystery from the last century. In February 1959, a group of nine experienced Russian mountaineers perished during a difficult expedition in the northern Urals. A snow avalanche hypothesis was proposed, among other theories, but was found to be inconsistent with the evidence of a lower-than-usual slope angle, scarcity of avalanche signs, uncertainties about the trigger mechanism, and abnormal injuries of the victims. The challenge of explaining these observations has led us to a physical mechanism for a slab avalanche caused by progressive wind-blown snow accumulation on the slope above the hikers' tent. Here we show how a combination of irregular topography, a cut made in the slope to install the tent and the subsequent deposition of snow induced by strong katabatic winds contributed after a suitable time to the slab release, which caused severe non-fatal injuries, in agreement with the autopsy results.",

Results of this study support the idea that katabatic flow can be locally enhanced by the diurnal cycle of solar insolation and the temperature contrast between the continent and the ocean. The interaction between katabatic wind and local thermal effects is expressed in terms of scale analysis. Except for surface stress, all terms in the momentum equation for a katabatic flow in a coastal region of Antarctica can reach the same order of magnitude. The local circulation then is the result of a relatively tenuous force balance which can be disrupted even by a weak perturbation of any term. To estimate the effect of the temperature contrast between the ocean and the continent on the katabatic flow, two numerical experiments have been conducted. The simulations consider an ocean free of sea ice representative of the summer months, and another winter case with the ocean covered by thick sea ice. These simulations show that with the ocean free of sea ice, the katabatic flows extend only a limited distance over the open ocean during the day due to the local thermal effects. With the ocean covered by sea ice, the katabatic winds are not constrained and extend a considerable distance offshore.",

      ],
      "abstract": "Meteorological observations performed in the melting zone of the Greenland ice sheet during GIMEX-90/91 show the regular occurrence of moderately strong barrier-winds. The barrier wind is a thermally generated jet that develops when the large-scale flow advects warm tundra air towards the cold, melting ice sheet, creating a large local horizontal gradient of temperature. As a result, the geostrophic wind in the atmospheric boundary-layer acquires a component perpendicular to the temperature gradient. In the melting zone of the ice sheet, barrier winds interact with persistent surface-based katabatic winds. The forcing mechanisms and detailed two-dimensional structure of the barrier wind have been investigated with a mesoscale meteorological model. The model results confirm the important role of the warm tundra during the development of barrier winds. Barrier winds cause a pronounced rise in temperature and a strong increase of turbulent exchange in the lower melting zone: friction velocity and sensible-heat flux in the melting zone showed peak values of 1.3 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP> and 300 W m<SUP>‑2</SUP> respectively. In combination with large positive net radiation, the daily melt rate increased to 10 cm water equivalent, which is twice the rate in typical katabatic wind conditions. This shows that barrier winds could have a significant impact on the melt regime of areas where the ice sheet ends in the tundra. Although barrier winds in this part of Greenland may occur less frequently than the observations during GIMEX-90 suggest, they are of great importance for the climate of this and of other polar regions, such as the Antarctic, and so merit careful study.",

However, great uncertainties still exist on the climate drivers of past and present glacier changes across scales. Here, we analyse continuous hourly climate station data from a glacierized elevation (Pyramid station, Mount Everest) since 1994 together with other ground observations and climate reanalysis. We show that a decrease in maximum air temperature and precipitation occurred during the last three decades at Pyramid in response to global warming. Reanalysis data suggest a broader occurrence of this effect in the glacierized areas of the Himalaya. We hypothesize that the counterintuitive cooling is caused by enhanced sensible heat exchange and the associated increase in glacier katabatic wind, which draws cool air downward from higher elevations. The stronger katabatic winds have also lowered the elevation of local wind convergence, thereby diminishing precipitation in glacial areas and negatively affecting glacier mass balance. This local cooling may have partially preserved glaciers from melting and could help protect the periglacial environment.",

The aim of this study is to investigate how turbulent energy and momentum flux are perturbed by the flow interaction with topography and by the strong mechanical mixing produced by downslope flows. Spectral and cospectral analyses, performed on the wind velocity components, provide evidence that such a perturbation, at any stability, is restricted to frequencies lower than the inertial subrange. Longitudinal spectra display an energy increment, due to turbulence generated by topography and by mechanical forcing related to the katabatic wind structure. The energy, supplied by the topographic forcing, displaces the turbulent energy maximum toward lower frequencies. In near-neutral stratification the spectral maximum occurs at a reduced frequency, which seems to be consistent with the height of the steepest part of the slope, and seems to shift toward higher frequencies as a linear ,function of the local stability parameter,L<SUB>l</SUB>. The parameterisation of the orographic perturbation by means of a similarity relationship allows us to scale u spectra in the same way as over uniform terrain. The scaled, perturbed spectra collapse onto a unique curve in the mid-frequency as well in the inertial subrange, while maxima are grouped in a cluster. Lateral and vertical velocity spectra exhibit shapes independent of stability, suggesting a topographic perturbation that is predominantly over stability effects.",

However, anthropogenic emissions are predicted to increase substantially in the short-term (2030) and medium-term (2050) futures in India, especially if no further policy efforts are made. In this study, the EMEP/MSC-W chemical transport model has been used to predict changes in surface ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) and fine particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>) for India in a world of changing emissions and climate. The reference scenario (for present-day) is evaluated against surface-based measurements, mainly at urban stations.

The evaluation shows high temporal correlation for O<SUB>3</SUB> (r = 0.9) and high spatial correlation for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> (r = 0.5 and r = 0.8 depending on the data set) between the model results and observations. While the overall bias in PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> is small (lower than 6 %), the model overestimates O<SUB>3</SUB> by 35 %. The underestimation in NO<SUB>x</SUB> titration is probably the main reason for the O<SUB>3</SUB> overestimation in the model. However, the level of agreement can be considered satisfactory in this case of a regional model being evaluated against mainly urban measurements, and given the inevitable uncertainties in much of the input data.For the 2050s, the model predicts that climate change will have distinct effects in India in terms of O<SUB>3</SUB> pollution, with a region in the north characterized by a statistically significant increase by up to 4 % (2 ppb) and one in the south by a decrease up to -3 % (-1.4 ppb). This variation in O<SUB>3</SUB> is assumed to be partly related to changes in O<SUB>3</SUB> deposition velocity caused by changes in soil moisture and, over a few areas, partly also by changes in biogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds.Our calculations suggest that PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> will increase by up to 6.5 % over the Indo-Gangetic Plain by the 2050s. The increase over India is driven by increases in dust, particulate organic matter (OM) and secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), which are mainly affected by the change in precipitation, biogenic emissions and wind speed.The large increase in anthropogenic emissions has a larger impact than climate change, causing O<SUB>3</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> levels to increase by 13 and 67 % on average in the 2050s over the main part of India, respectively. By the 2030s, secondary inorganic aerosol is predicted to become the second largest contributor to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> in India, and the largest in the 2050s, exceeding OM and dust.",

      "abstract": "Since multilayer cloud scenes are common in the atmosphere and can be an important source of uncertainty in passive satellite sensor cloud retrievals, the MODIS MOD06 and MYD06 standard cloud optical property products include a multilayer cloud detection algorithm to assist with data quality assessment. This paper presents an evaluation of the Aqua MODIS MYD06 Collection 6 multilayer cloud detection algorithm through comparisons with active Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) products that have the ability to provide cloud vertical distributions and directly classify multilayer cloud scenes and layer properties. To compare active sensor products with an imager such as MODIS, it is first necessary to define multilayer clouds in the context of their radiative impact on cloud retrievals. Three main parameters have thus been considered in this evaluation: (1) the maximum separation distance between two cloud layers, (2) the thermodynamic phase of those layers and (3) the upper-layer cloud optical thickness. The impact of including the Pavolonis-Heidinger multilayer cloud detection algorithm, introduced in Collection 6, to assist with multilayer cloud detection has also been assessed. For the year 2008, the MYD06 C6 multilayer cloud detection algorithm identifies roughly 20 % of all cloudy pixels as multilayer (decreasing to about 13 % if the Pavolonis-Heidinger algorithm output is not used). Evaluation against the merged CPR and CALIOP 2B-CLDCLASS-lidar product shows that the MODIS multilayer detection results are quite sensitive to how multilayer clouds are defined in the radar and lidar product and that the algorithm performs better when the optical thickness of the upper cloud layer is greater than about 1.2 with a minimum layer separation distance of 1 km. Finally, we find that filtering the MYD06 cloud optical properties retrievals using the multilayer cloud flag improves aggregated statistics, particularly for ice cloud effective radius.",

This comprises monovalent TCR ligands anchored to lithographically patterned nanoparticle clusters surrounded by mobile adhesion molecules on a supported lipid bilayer. The TCR ligand could be co-planar with the supported lipid bilayer (2D), excluding the CD45 transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, or elevated by 10 nm on solid nanopedestals (3D), allowing closer access of CD45 to engaged TCR. The two configurations resulted in different T cell responses, depending on the lateral spacing between the ligands. These results identify the important contributions of lateral and axial components of ligand positioning and create a more complete foundation for receptor engineering for immunotherapy.",

The main objective of the experiment is to assess the efficiency of air pollutant emissions mitigation measures in improving regional-scale air quality. <BR /><BR /> The present paper formulates the main scientific questions and policy issues being addressed by the EURODELTA-Trends modelling experiment with an emphasis on how the design and technical features of the modelling experiment answer these questions. <BR /><BR /> The experiment is designed in three tiers, with increasing degrees of computational demand in order to facilitate the participation of as many modelling teams as possible. The basic experiment consists of simulations for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Sensitivity analysis for the same three years using various combinations of (i) anthropogenic emissions, (ii) chemical boundary conditions, and (iii) meteorology complements it. The most demanding tier consists of two complete time series from 1990 to 2010, simulated using either time-varying emissions for corresponding years or constant emissions.<BR /><BR /> Eight chemistry-transport models have contributed with calculation results to at least one experiment tier, and five models have - to date - completed the full set of simulations (and 21-year trend calculations have been performed by four models). The modelling results are publicly available for further use by the scientific community. <BR /><BR /> The main expected outcomes are (i) an evaluation of the models' performances for the three reference years, (ii) an evaluation of the skill of the models in capturing observed air pollution trends for the 1990-2010 time period, (iii) attribution analyses of the respective role of driving factors (e.g. emissions, boundary conditions, meteorology), (iv) a dataset based on a multi-model approach, to provide more robust model results for use in impact studies related to human health, ecosystem, and radiative forcing.",

The three major soluble sugars in plants are sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Information on plant glucose and sucrose signaling is available, but to date no fructose-specific signaling pathway has been reported. In this study, sugar repression of seedling development was used to study fructose sensitivity in the Landsberg erecta (Ler)/Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) recombinant inbred line population, and eight fructose-sensing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (FSQ1-8) were mapped. Among them, FSQ6 was confirmed to be a fructose-specific QTL by analyzing near-isogenic lines in which Cvi genomic fragments were introgressed in the Ler background. These results indicate the existence of a fructose-specific signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. Further analysis demonstrated that the FSQ6-associated fructose-signaling pathway functions independently of the hexokinase1 (HXK1) glucose sensor. Remarkably, fructose-specific FSQ6 downstream signaling interacts with abscisic acid (ABA)- and ethylene-signaling pathways, similar to HXK1-dependent glucose signaling. The Cvi allele of FSQ6 acts as a suppressor of fructose signaling. The FSQ6 gene was identified using map-based cloning approach, and FSQ6 was shown to encode the transcription factor gene Arabidopsis NAC (petunia No apical meristem and Arabidopsis transcription activation factor 1, 2 and Cup-shaped cotyledon 2) domain containing protein 89 (ANAC089). The Cvi allele of FSQ6/ANAC089 is a gain-of-function allele caused by a premature stop in the third exon of the gene. The truncated Cvi FSQ6/ANAC089 protein lacks a membrane association domain that is present in ANAC089 proteins from other Arabidopsis accessions. As a result, Cvi FSQ6/ANAC089 is constitutively active as a transcription factor in the nucleus.",

      "abstract": "Animal population sizes are often estimated using aerial sample counts by human observers, both for wildlife and livestock. The associated methods of counting remained more or less the same since the 1970s, but suffer from low precision and low accuracy of population estimates. Aerial counts using cost-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or microlight aircrafts with cameras and an automated animal detection algorithm can potentially improve this precision and accuracy. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the multi-class convolutional neural network RetinaNet in detecting elephants, giraffes and zebras in aerial images from two Kenyan animal counts. The algorithm detected 95% of the number of elephants, 91% of giraffes and 90% of zebras that were found by four layers of human annotation, of which it correctly detected an extra 2.8% of elephants, 3.8% giraffes and 4.0% zebras that were missed by all humans, while detecting only 1.6 to 5.0 false positives per true positive. Furthermore, the animal detections by the algorithm were less sensitive to the sighting distance than humans were. With such a high recall and precision, we posit it is feasible to replace manual aerial animal count methods (from images and/or directly) by only the manual identification of image bounding boxes selected by the algorithm and then use a correction factor equal to the inverse of the undercounting bias in the calculation of the population estimates. This correction factor causes the standard error of the population estimate to increase slightly compared to a manual method, but this increase can be compensated for when the sampling effort would increase by 23%. However, an increase in sampling effort of 160% to 1,050% can be attained with the same expenses for equipment and personnel using our proposed semi-automatic method compared to a manual method. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed aerial count method will improve the accuracy of population estimates and will decrease the standard error of population estimates by 31% to 67%. Most importantly, this animal detection algorithm has the potential to outperform humans in detecting animals from the air when supplied with images taken at a fixed rate. Foreign Language Abstract Abstrak (Afrikaans) Mense gebruik dikwels lugmonsteropnames om die grootte van dierebevolkings, beide wild en lewende hawe, vas te stel. Die verwante opnamemetodes het sedert die 1970s feitlik onveranderd gebly en gevolglik is sodanige opnames nie altyd presies of akkuraat nie. Lugopnames wat Onbemande Lugvaartuie of mikroligte vliegtuie, wat met kameras toegerus is, asook 'n ge-automatiseerde opsommingsalgoritme het die potensiaal om hierde presiesheid en akkuraatheid te verhoog. Ons het derhalwe die verrigting van die multiklas konvolutionere netwerk RetinaNet ge-evalueer waar dit in Kenia in twee opnames in die opsporing van olifante, kameelperde en sebras gebruik is. Die algoritme het aangedui dat 95% van die getal olifante, 91% van die kameelperde en 90% van die sebras onderskeidelik wat deur vier lae menslike annotasie uitgewys is en waarin daar korrek 'n addisionele 2.8% olifante, 3.8% kameelperde en 4% sebras waargeneem is, deur al die mense misgekyk is, terwyl slegs 1.6 to 5.0 valse positiewes per werklike positief ontdek is. Verder was die algoritme se resultate minder sensitief ten opsigte van die gesigsafstand as die van die menslike waarnemers. Met sulke omvattende terugvoer en presiesheid glo ons dat die vervanging van handgedrewe lugopnames van diere (beide beelde en/of direk) deur slegs handgedrewe identifikasie van \"image bounding boxes\" deur die algoritme geselekteer, uitvoerbaar sou wees, en om dan 'n korreksiefaktor te gebruik gelyk aan die inverse van die ondertelling onewewigtigheid in die berekening van die bevolkingsberaming. Hierdie faktor sal dan die standaard fout marginaal laat toeneem vergeleke met 'n handgedrewe metode. Hierdie toename sou gekompenseer kon word indien die proefneming met 23% sou verhoog. 'n Toename van 160% tot 1,050% sou moontlik wees met soortgelyke uitgawes vir toerusting sowel as personeel, deur die gebruik van ons voorgestelde semi-automatiese metode vergeleke met 'n konvensionele metode. Ons gevolgtrekking is derhalwe dat die voorgestelde berekeningsmetode die akkuraatheid van geskatte bevolkings grootliks sal verhoog. Dit sal ook die standaard afwyking in bevolkingsberamings verminder met tussen 31% en 67%. Veral belangrik is dat hierdie algoritme dit moontlik kan maak om menslike lugwaarnemingsmetodes te oortref indien dit met beelde, teen'n konstante tempo vasgevang, vervang word.",

Basic principles governing these search mechanisms remain poorly understood, and no study has provided direct visualization of single proteins searching for and engaging target sites. Here we use the postreplicative mismatch repair proteins MutSα and MutLα as model systems for understanding diffusion-based target searches. Using single-molecule microscopy, we directly visualize MutSα as it searches for DNA lesions, MutLα as it searches for lesion-bound MutSα, and the MutSα/MutLα complex as it scans the flanking DNA. We also show that MutLα undergoes intersite transfer between juxtaposed DNA segments while searching for lesion-bound MutSα, but this activity is suppressed upon association with MutSα, ensuring that MutS/MutL remains associated with the damage-bearing strand while scanning the flanking DNA. Our findings highlight a hierarchy of lesion- and ATP-dependent transitions involving both MutSα and MutLα, and help establish how different modes of diffusion can be used during recognition and repair of damaged DNA.",

      "abstract": "Remote sensing of cloud effective particle size with passive sensors like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an important tool for cloud microphysical studies. As a measure of the radiatively relevant droplet size, effective radius can be retrieved with different combinations of visible through shortwave and midwave infrared channels. In practice, retrieved effective radii from these combinations can be quite different. This difference is perhaps indicative of different penetration depths and path lengths for the spectral reflectances used. In addition, operational liquid water cloud retrievals are based on the assumption of a relatively narrow distribution of droplet sizes; the role of larger precipitation particles in these distributions is neglected. Therefore, possible explanations for the discrepancy in some MODIS spectral size retrievals could include 3-D radiative transport effects, including sub-pixel cloud inhomogeneity, and/or the impact of drizzle formation. <BR /><BR /> For three cloud cases the possible factors of influence are isolated and investigated in detail by the use of simulated cloud scenes and synthetic satellite data: marine boundary layer cloud scenes from large eddy simulations (LES) with detailed microphysics are combined with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations that explicitly account for the detailed droplet size distributions as well as 3-D radiative transfer to simulate MODIS observations. The operational MODIS optical thickness and effective radius retrieval algorithm is applied to these and the results are compared to the given LES microphysics. <BR /><BR /> We investigate two types of marine cloud situations each with and without drizzle from LES simulations: (1) a typical daytime stratocumulus deck at two times in the diurnal cycle and (2) one scene with scattered cumulus. Only small impact of drizzle formation on the retrieved domain average and on the differences between the three effective radius retrievals is noticed for both cloud scene types for different reasons. For our, presumably typical, overcast stratocumulus scenes with an optical thickness of 8 to 9 and rain rates at cloud bottom up to 0.05 mm/h clear drizzle impact on the retrievals can be excluded. The cumulus scene does not show much drizzle sensitivity either despite extended drizzle areas being directly visible from above (locally &gt;1 mm/h), which is mainly due to technical characteristics of the standard retrieval approach. 3-D effects, on the other hand, produce large discrepancies between the 1.6 and 2.1 μm channel observations compared to 3.7 μm retrievals in the latter case. A general sensitivity of MODIS particle size data to drizzle formation is not corroborated by our case studies.",

AEs are nonionic surfactants composed of a homologous series of molecules that range in alkyl chain length from 12 to 18 carbons and ethoxylates from 0 to 18 units. Chronic ecotoxicity of AE is summarized for 17 species in 60 tests and then normalized to monitoring data for AE mixtures. To do so, chronic aquatic toxicity was first expressed as EC <SUB>10</SUB> per species (the concentration predicted to cause a 10% reduction in an important ecological endpoint). Normalization integrated several new quantitative structure-activity relationships for algae, daphnids, fish, and mesocosms and provided an interpretation of toxicity test data as a function of individual homologs in an AE mixture. SSDs were constructed for each homolog and the HC <SUB>5</SUB> (hazardous concentration protective of 95% of species based on a small biological effect [the chronic EC <SUB>10</SUB>]) was predicted. Total mass of AE in monitored effluents from 29 sites in Europe, Canada, and the United States averaged 6.8, 2.8, and 3.55 μg/L, respectively. For risk assessment purposes, correction of exposure to account for fatty alcohol derived from sources other than AE and for sorbed components based on experimental evidence was used to determine AE concentrations in undiluted (100%) effluents from North America and Europe. Exposure and effect findings were integrated in a toxic unit (TU)-based model that considers the measured distribution of individual AE homologs in effluent with their corresponding SSDs. Use of environmentally relevant exposure corrections (bioavailability and accounting for AE-derived alcohol) resulted in TUs ranging from 0.015 to 0.212. Low levels of risk are concluded for AE in the aquatic environments of Europe and North America.",

Recent publications report on ABI4 as a regulatory factor in diverse processes. In developing seedlings, ABI4 mediates sugar signaling, lipid breakdown, and plastid-to-nucleus signaling. Moreover, ABI4 is a regulator of rosette growth, redox signaling, cell wall metabolism and the effect of nitrate on lateral root development.",

      "abstract": "Chasma Boreale, a large reentrant in the north polar cap of Mars, is distinct in scale, detailed topography, and orientation from the spiraling troughs that characterize the majority of the polar cap. We use new, high-resolution Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Viking images of the chasma region to assess hypotheses of origin of Chasma Boreale. These hypotheses include formation by glacial flow and ablation, by eolian processes (such as katabatic winds) and sublimation, by outflow of meltwater, or by a combination of two or more of these processes. We find that these new data support initial formation by outflow of meltwater with later modification by katabatic winds and sublimation. On the basis of our analysis we suggest a possible scenario in which outflow has occurred in several stages. The outflow appears to have begun near an enclosed depression at the head of the chasma; meltwater migrated within and below the ice down the regional slope and eventually broke out to the surface. Removal of material by melting caused subsidence and erosion of the polar deposits forming the chasma, which has subsequently undergone modification by eolian and sublimation processes. The outflow deposited most of its sediment in the form of a lobe that stratigraphically overlies the polygonal plains mapped at the mouth of the chasma and scoured some of the circumpolar sediment mantle in the surrounding region. The lowest portions of the North Polar Basin received the rest of the sediment as a deposit a few meters thick. MOLA data also reveal evidence for similar events of smaller magnitude elsewhere on the margins of the polar cap.",

      "abstract": "A detailed examination of the location and orientation of sand dunes and other aeolian features within the north polar chasmata indicates that steep scarps strongly influence the direction and intensity of prevailing winds. These steep scarps are present at the heads and along the margins of the north polar chasmata. Topographic profiles of the arcuate head scarps and equator-facing wall of Chasma Boreale reveal unusually steep polar slopes ranging from ∼6°-30°. The relatively steep-sloped (∼8°), sinuous scarp at the head of two smaller chasmata, located west of Chasma Boreale, exhibits an obvious resistant cap-forming unit. Scarp retreat is occurring in places where the cap unit is actively being undercut by descending slope winds. Low-albedo surfaces lacking sand dunes or dust mantles are present at the base of the polar scarps. A ∼100-300 m deep moat, located at the base of the scarps, corresponds with these surfaces and indicates an area of active aeolian scour from descending katabatic winds. Small local dust storms observed along the equator-facing wall of Chasma Boreale imply that slope wind velocities in Chasma Boreale are sufficient to mobilize dust and sand-sized particles in the Polar Layered Deposits (PLD). Two amphitheater forms, located above the cap-forming unit of the sinuous scarp and west of Chasma Boreale, may represent an early stage of polar scarp and chasma formation. These two forms are developing within a younger section of polar layered materials. The unusually steep scarps associated with the polar chasmata have developed where resistant layers are present in the PLD, offering resistance during the headward erosion and poleward retreat of the scarps. Steep slopes that formed under these circumstances enhance the flow of down-scarp katabatic winds. On the basis of these observations, we reject the fluvial outflood hypothesis for the origin of the north polar chasmata and embrace a wind erosion model for their long-term development. In the aeolian model, off-pole katabatic winds progressively remove materials from the steep slopes below chasmata scarps, undermining resistant layers at the tops of scarps and causing retreat by headward erosion. Assuming a minimum age for the onset of formation of Chasma Boreale (10 <SUP>5</SUP> yr) results in a maximum volumetric erosion rate of 0.35 kmyr. Removal of this volume of material from the equator-facing wall and head scarps of chasma would require a rate for scarp retreat of 0.5 myr.",

These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC<SUP>4</SUP>) experiment conducted over Central America and surrounding Pacific and Atlantic Oceans between 17 July and 8 August 2007. Multispectral images in eleven distinct bands were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud) over land and ocean ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of the cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds (liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). The cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both liquid water and ice clouds that were detected during each flight, using a nearly identical algorithm to that implemented operationally to process MODIS cloud data from the Aqua and Terra satellites (Collection 5). This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS and MASTER data in TC<SUP>4</SUP>, is quite capable of distinguishing both liquid water and ice clouds during daytime conditions over both land and ocean. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals use five distinct bands of the MAS (or MASTER), and these results were compared with nearly simultaneous retrievals of marine liquid water clouds from MODIS on the Terra spacecraft. Finally, this MODIS-based algorithm was adapted to Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data to infer the cloud optical thickness of liquid water clouds from MISR. Results of this analysis are compared and contrasted.",

In chemical shift imaging (CSI) experiments performed using a few thousand total scans, the choline methyl line is shown to have an acceptable SNR in resolved volume elements containing only 50 pL of sample, and localized spectra are resolved from just 5 pL in the Xenopus globule. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of performing <SUP>1</SUP>H NMR on picoliter-scale sample volumes in biological cells and tissues and illustrate how the achieved SNR in spectroscopic images can be predicted with reasonable accuracy at microscopic spatial resolutions.",

The reflectance, transmittance and ellipsometric coefficient are calculated in this limit and the results are compared with those obtained by Ohlídal and co-workers in the same limit. It is proved that the difference in results found is a direct consequence of the neglect of local curvature of the rough surface by these authors, which is an inconsistent approximation in the second order theory.",

The science community is entering a new era where we are producing TB-sized geospatial products from PB-sized satellite imagery, meaning sub-meter resolution across the entire Arctic region and at different dates. Unless you want to download just a small portion of the data, these datasets are too large to handle for the typical computer. The PDG is making the big datasets accessible and discoverable for anyone, no matter your technical skills or computer resources. All you need is an internet connection. The PDG is also providing the technical workflow to enable pan-Arctic application of remote sensing algorithms, including machine-learning approaches. The PDG visualization tools (Fluid Earth Viewer and ImageryViewer) provides basic map-viewing capabilities of the big geospatial datasets from the individual feature to the pan-Arctic, while also including ancillary popular datasets such as soils, vegetation, infrastructure, climate and weather. A third tool (PlotViewer) will allow the user to create 2-4D graphs informed by the big geospatial datasets and the ancillary maps. Additional features in the development pipeline include cyberinfrastructure to support community-development of training data for ML applications, space for people to write their own code to analyze the datasets in their entirety, and teaching modules for teachers and aspiring professionals to learn about artificial intelligence approaches in producing and analyzing geospatial data. The PDG aims to support and connect the community interested in big geospatial data for permafrost landscapes.",

Crustal domains formed after 3.6 Ga depict a more complex evolution, involving contribution from chondritic mantle sources and, to a lesser extent, reworking of pre-existing crust. Protracted remelting was not accompanied by significant mantle depletion prior to 3.35 Ga. This implies that early crust production in the Zimbabwe Craton did not cause complementary enriched and depleted reservoirs that were tapped by later magmas, possibly because the volume of crust extracted and stabilised was too small to influence (asthenospheric) mantle isotopic evolution. Growth of continental crust through pulsed emplacement of juvenile (chondritic mantle-derived) melts, into and onto the existing cratonic nucleus, however, involved formation of complementary depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle since the early Archaean, indicative of strongly coupled evolutionary histories of both reservoirs, with limited evidence for recycling and lateral accretion of arc-related crustal blocks until 3.35 Ga.",

Yet, few practical examples of embedding of these instruments in river management organizations can be observed so far. This paper identifies the possible organizational, technical, and scientific factors that may form an obstacle for the design and application of a Decision-Support System (DSS) for river-basin management by analyzing the interaction between the different participants in the Elbe DSS project. In particular attention is paid to the software engineering aspects of the design process. In order to start an integrated approach to deal with conflicting river strategies a project to develop a prototype tool for integrated management of the Elbe catchment was initiated, which includes functionalities related to inland navigation, water quality, flood safety, and vegetation ecology. The problems faced in the German part of the Elbe catchment range from poor navigation conditions and flooding vulnerability to a need to restore and maintain the natural state of the floodplains. Several river engineering works such as large-scale dike shifting, channel dredging, and large-scale retention are in a planning or implementation stage. From the beginning of the project onwards attention was paid to the involvement of potential end-users and key stakeholders in the design process. The experience of the project is that internal consistency of models and data, effective communication, and functional flexibility are essential to warrant a proper balance between scientific standards, the availability of models, and the requirements of users. This facilitates the design process and improves the chance of successful implementation.",

In this paper, we describe a relatively simple algorithm to detect multiple cloud layers and distinguish them from vertically-extended clouds. The algorithm can be applied to coincident passive sensors that derive both cloud-top pressure from the thermal infrared observations and an estimate of solar photon pathlength from UV, visible, or near-IR measurements. Here, we use data from the A-train afternoon constellation of satellites: cloud-top pressure, cloud optical thickness, the multi-layer flag from the Aqua MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the optical centroid cloud pressure from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). For the first time, we use data from the CloudSat radar to evaluate the results of a multi-layer cloud detection scheme. The cloud classification algorithms applied with different passive sensor configurations compare well with each other as well as with data from CloudSat.<BR /> <BR /> We compute monthly mean fractions of pixels containing multi-layer and vertically-extended clouds for January and July 2007 at the OMI spatial resolution (12 km×24 km at nadir) and at the 5 km×5 km MODIS resolution used for infrared cloud retrievals. There are seasonal variations in the spatial distribution of the different cloud types. The fraction of cloudy pixels containing distinct multi-layer cloud is a strong function of the pixel size. Globally averaged, these fractions are approximately 20% and 10% for OMI and MODIS, respectively. These fractions may be significantly higher or lower depending upon location. There is a much smaller resolution dependence for fractions of pixels containing vertically-extended clouds (~20% for OMI and slightly less for MODIS globally), suggesting larger spatial scales for these clouds. We also find higher fractions of vertically-extended clouds over land as compared with ocean, particularly in the tropics and summer hemisphere.",

      "abstract": "Surface winds over Antarctica, often classified as \"katabatic,\" are intimately related to the orientation and steepness of the underlying ice terrain. Such flows result primarily from the strong radiational cooling of the sloping ice surface which creates a downslope-directed horizontal pressure gradient force. It is possible to diagnose the time-averaged, near-surface streamline patterns of cold air drainage currents using recently compiled, detailed Antarctic ice topography maps and appropriate estimates of the strength of the surface temperature inversion. The resulting streamlines agree with available observations and illustrate the high degree of nonuniformity of gravity-driven flows off the ice sheets. In certain interior sections, negatively buoyant air from a large catchment area drains through a restricted section of coastline. Such confluence zones represent regions of enhanced supplies of cold air and are shown to be related to anomalously strong katabatic winds. Implications for sea ice formation are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Precipitation in Antarctica is a crucial component of the ice sheet mass balance, which directly impacts sea-level rise. On the Antarctic coast, extratropical cyclones contribute to most of the precipitation accumulation. However, snowfall associated with these systems often sublimates in the dry katabatic layer present over the East Antarctic coast, leading to a decrease of up to 35% of the total snowfall accumulation. Davis station is located in one of the driest regions of Antarctica and experiences katabatics despite being sheltered by low-level hills from the plateau. Nevertheless, sublimation of snowfall has not yet been properly documented there. In this study, we analyse two contrasted snowfall events that took place in January 2019 in Davis station Antarctica, using data from a scanning X-band polarimetric radar, a W-band Doppler cloud profiler, a multi-angle snowflake camera (MASC) and a Raman lidar collected during the PLATO campaign. The first event took place on 06 January 2019. A local-scale circulation developed offshore Davis bringing a shallow precipitating system with cloud top at about 3800 m a.s.l. The katabatic layer was weak with wind speeds below 10 m/s. Partial sublimation can be observed as a slight decrease in reflectivity and increase in mean Doppler vertical velocity values, but most of the precipitation reached the ground. A hydrometeor classification based on the polarimetric variables shows the dominance of crystals, as well as aggregates below 2000 m a.s.l. (T &gt; -16°C). After the passage of this shallow cloud, isolated precipitating cells containing rimed particles were observed, consistent with supercooled liquid water layers identified in the lidar data. The hydrometeor classification from the MASC shows a majority of aggregates followed by small particles and graupels, consistent with the radar-based classification. The second event took place between 08-09 January 2019. An extratropical cyclone advected moist unstable air from the Southern Ocean. The warm front reached Davis with cloud top at 8000 m a.s.l and reflectivity values up to 30 dBZ at X-band. Despite the intense reflectivity, most of the snowfall sublimated completely, due to a strong katabatic layer with wind speed up to 39 m/s and relative humidity as low as 60%. These two case studies suggest that the strength of the katabatic layer is more decisive than the amount of advected moisture: while shallow precipitating clouds can lead to significant precipitation amount, strong frontal snowfall can almost totally sublimate in the katabatic layer.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of the EURODELTA-Trends (EDT) modeling experiment, several chemical transport models (CTMs) were applied for the 1990-2010 period to investigate air quality changes in Europe as well as the capability of the models to reproduce observed long-term air quality trends. Five CTMs have provided modeled air quality data for 21 continuous years in Europe using emission scenarios prepared by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis/Greenhouse Gas - Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (IIASA/GAINS) and corresponding year-by-year meteorology derived from ERA-Interim global reanalysis. For this study, long-term observations of particle sulfate (SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP>), total nitrate (TNO<SUB>3</SUB>), total ammonium (TNH<SUB>x</SUB>) as well as sulfur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) for multiple sites in Europe were used to evaluate the model results. The trend analysis was performed for the full 21 years (referred to as PT) but also for two 11-year subperiods: 1990-2000 (referred to as P1) and 2000-2010 (referred to as P2). <P />The experiment revealed that the models were able to reproduce the faster decline in observed SO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations during the first decade, i.e., 1990-2000, with a 64 %-76 % mean relative reduction in SO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations indicated by the EDT experiment (range of all the models) versus an 82 % mean relative reduction in observed concentrations. During the second decade (P2), the models estimated a mean relative reduction in SO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations of about 34 %-54 %, which was also in line with that observed (47 %). Comparisons of observed and modeled NO<SUB>2</SUB> trends revealed a mean relative decrease of 25 % and between 19 % and 23 % (range of all the models) during the P1 period, and 12 % and between 22 % and 26 % (range of all the models) during the P2 period, respectively. <P />Comparisons of observed and modeled trends in SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> concentrations during the P1 period indicated that the models were able to reproduce the observed trends at most of the sites, with a 42 %-54 % mean relative reduction indicated by the EDT experiment (range of all models) versus a 57 % mean relative reduction in observed concentrations and with good performance also during the P2 and PT periods, even though all the models overpredicted the number of statistically significant decreasing trends during the P2 period. Moreover, especially during the P1 period, both modeled and observational data indicated smaller reductions in SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> concentrations compared with their gas-phase precursor (i.e., SO<SUB>2</SUB>), which could be mainly attributed to increased oxidant levels and pH-dependent cloud chemistry. <P />An analysis of the trends in TNO<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations indicated a 28 %-39 % and 29 % mean relative reduction in TNO<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations for the full period for model data (range of all the models) and observations, respectively. Further analysis of the trends in modeled HNO<SUB>3</SUB> and particle nitrate (NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>) concentrations revealed that the relative reduction in HNO<SUB>3</SUB> was larger than that for NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> during the P1 period, which was mainly attributed to an increased availability of \"free ammonia\". By contrast, trends in modeled HNO<SUB>3</SUB> and NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> concentrations were more comparable during the P2 period. Also, trends of TNH<SUB>x</SUB> concentrations were, in general, underpredicted by all models, with worse performance for the P1 period than for P2. <P />Trends in modeled anthropogenic and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (ASOA and BSOA) concentrations together with the trends in available emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) were also investigated. A strong decrease in ASOA was indicated by all the models, following the reduction in anthropogenic non-methane VOC (NMVOC) precursors. Biogenic emission data provided by the modeling teams indicated a few areas with statistically significant increase in isoprene emissions and monoterpene emissions during the 1990-2010 period over Fennoscandia and eastern European regions (i.e., around 14 %-27 %), which was mainly attributed to the increase of surface temperature. However, the modeled BSOA concentrations did not linearly follow the increase in biogenic emissions. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation against positive matrix factorization (PMF) data, available during the second period (P2) at various European sites, revealed a systematic underestimation of the modeled SOA fractions of a factor of 3 to 11, on average, most likely because of missing SOA precursors and formation pathways, with reduced biases for the models that accounted for chemical aging of semi-volatile SOA components in the atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "From Maxwell's equations, it follows that a magnetic field, in a vacuum, is fully determined by its boundary values. If boundary observations are fitted with a model obeying the known constraints, the difference between the real and the fitted field must reach its maximum at the boundary. Theoretically therefore the optimal method is to measure a field component at the boundary. A method is given here to solve the above boundary problem. It is assumed that a function with zero Laplacian is known at rectangular grid points at the six boundary planes of a rectangular box. The solution is given as expansions in trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. This method has been applied to several spectrometer magnets. Because the model is essentially orthogonal, the evaluation of the coefficients requires very little computing time (20 sec of CDC 6600 time to evaluate 1200 coefficients from 14 000 boundary observations of one component). To derive the field rapidly at any point, a three-dimensional grid, sufficiently dense for linear or quadratic interpolation, can be generated.",

Though this result has been confirmed experimentally, in many samples within measuring error an exponential Zeeman relaxation has been observed. In order to decide whether or not this is contradictory to the theory the degree of nonexponentiality has been further investigated in this paper. It is shown that the nonexponential character depends stronly on the following parameters: (i) the way in which the spin system is prepared for the observation of the Zeeman relaxation, (ii) the number of protons not belonging to the methyl groups, (iii) the relaxation due to the intermethyl dipolar interactions, and (iv) the temperature. It is found that under specific conditions the observed relaxation can become almost exponential. The corresponding time constant, however, can differ considerably from that predicted by the usual spin temperature theory. Therefore, the interpretation of the experiments with this theory can lead to incorrect values of the different parameters characterizing the relaxation process. The various results have been illustrated with experiments on polycrystalline samples of 2,6-dimethylphenol, methylcyanide, 2-methylpiperazine, and 1,4-dimethoxy-2,6-dimethylbenzene.",

By applying a voltage of 400 V corresponding to an external electric-field strength of 5×10<SUP>4</SUP> V/cm, the observed absorption change in this material is Δα/α~=0.07. The electrical field produces a redshift of the absorption band which is explained in terms of the quantum-confined Stark effect. In addition, a restoring of the oscillator strength is observed and explained by screening effects of internal fields in the interface region by the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. At high laser excitation an electric-field-induced change of the nonlinear absorption spectrum of Δα/α=0.25 is achieved, giving a considerable modulation of the absorption edge. The electrical field separates the laser excited carriers and the change in the absorption is attributed to a compensation of the many-particle interaction by the external electrical field.",

As linewidth decreased, the aggregate conversion versus time at temperature behavior slowed, and the conversion behaviors of individual lines having the same linewidth became more variable. Both of these observations are consistent with a nucleation-site-density controlled reaction under conditions of low nucleation site density. Correlations were also found between individual line behaviors and resistance to agglomeration; resistance to agglomeration (for 0.35-1.0 μm lines already in the C54 phase) was highest for lines which had ``prompt'' conversion behaviors (as measured by the sheet resistance drop during the first minute of the conversion anneal). Additional data concerning the sensitivity of the initial sheet resistances to formation anneal conditions and linewidth is also briefly discussed.",

In the anaerobic soil compartments sulfate is consumed by sulfate-reducing bacteria. In the rhizosphere the reduced sulfur compounds can be reoxidized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Measurements of the potential activity of thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria in soil slurries derived from planted rice soil microcosms showed turnover rates of 2–6 μmol d <SUP>-1</SUP> g-dw <SUP>-1</SUP>. Thiosulfate was oxidized to sulfate with tetrathionate as intermediate. Most probable number (MPN) enumeration with three aerobic media and one anaerobic nitrate-amended medium showed that thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria were abundant in paddy soil and in rhizosphere soil at numbers of 10 <SUP>5</SUP> to 10 <SUP>6</SUP> per gram dry weight soil. Nine isolates of S-oxidizing bacteria were obtained from enrichment cultures or from the highest dilutions of the MPN series and were affiliated to four different phylogenetic groups. These isolates were characterized by physiological properties and by comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Three isolates ( TA1-AE1, TA1-A1 and TA12-21) were shown to be facultatively chemolithoautotrophic strains of Ancylobacter aquaticus. Three further isolates ( Tv6-2b, Z2A-6A and Z4A-2A) were also facultatively chemolithoautotrophic and were affiliated with the Xanthobacter sp. group, probably representing new strains of X. flavus or X. tagetidis. Strain 5Z-2111 was phylogenetically related to Bosea thiooxidans. However, the genus Bosea is described as obligately heterotrophic, whereas strain 5Z-2111 was able to grow autotrophically. The isolates 5Z-C1 and TBW3 were obligate chemolithoautotrophs and were closely affiliated with Thiobacillus thioparus. Our results showed that S-oxidizing bacteria were abundant and active in rice paddy soil and consisted of physiologically and phylogenetically diverse populations.",

On the other hand, concentrations of AVS were also much higher in the upper layers of planted versus unplanted microcosms indicating that reduction of oxidized sulfur compounds was also stimulated in this zone. The highest AVS and CRS concentrations were 1.6 and 1.3 μmol cm ‑3 soil, respectively. Indeed, planted soils showed a two- to five-fold higher SRP and TCP (&lt; 2.8 and &lt; 1.9 μmol cm ‑3 d ‑1, respectively) compared to unplanted microcosms (&lt; 0.56 μmol cm ‑3 d ‑1). Concentrations of acetate and lactate were also higher, especially in the uppermost soil layers. However, SRP and TCP were only stimulated by the addition of hydrogen. SRB were enumerated by the MPN technique using hydrogen, acetate, propionate, lactate, butyrate, succinate and benzoate as electron donors. Vertical profiles indicated that the SRB were relatively homogenously distributed in the paddy soil microcosms. The SRB populations growing on H 2, propionate and succinate appeared to be higher in planted than in unplanted paddy soil microcosms although at a relatively low statistic significance (α &lt; 0.1). Enrichment cultures showed a relatively high diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria with respect to utilization of at least eight different substrates out of 21 substrates tested. The genera observed included Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum, Desulfobulbus, and Desulfobotulus. Our results indicate a very dynamic cycling of both reduced and oxidized sulfur species in the rhizosphere of planted paddy soil.",

The data obtained by photoluminescence, differential absorption and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy have been compared and a general size dependence could be established. Based on theoretical calculations, the dominant features in the spectra have been assigned to the different transitions from the ground state to the one-pair states. Within the lowest one pair transition, a fine structure due to exchange interaction has been observed. The change in the optical properties with increasing intensity has been studied and the two-pair states identified in luminescence. Spectrally broad optical gain has been found due to stimulated transitions involving both one- and two-pair states.",

      "abstract": "There is currently intensive public discussion of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and other electric powertrains, such as battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and hybridized combustion engine vehicles (HEV). In this context, the German government has set the target of one million electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and six million by 2030 [1]. The goal of this paper is to identify the possible market share of electric vehicles in the German new car fleet in three scenarios in the timeframe from 2010 to 2030. The VECTOR21 vehicle technology scenario model is used to model the fleet in three scenarios. In the reference scenario with business-as-usual parameters, 189,000 electric vehicles will be sold in Germany by 2020. Scenario two with purchase price incentives from 5000 EUR, high oil prices, and low prices for hydrogen and electricity will result in 727,000 vehicles. In the last scenario with substantial OEM mark-up reductions and external conditions as in the business-as-usual scenario, 3.28 million vehicles will be sold. Analysis shows that the market success of alternative powertrain vehicles depends to a great extent on external conditions. Without purchase price incentives, rising oil prices, and low energy costs for hydrogen and electricity, alternative powertrains will not enter the market. However, OEMs could stimulate the market if they accept negative mark-ups in the first 10 years after market introduction.",

One year after launch, Earth flyby data were used to refine the wavelength map by comparing OVIRS spectra with atmospheric models. Near-simultaneous data from other Earth-orbiting satellites were used to cross-calibrate the OVIRS absolute radiometric response, particularly at visible wavelengths. Trending data from internal calibration sources and the Sun show that instrument radiometric performance has been stable to better than 1% in the 18 months since launch.",

In addition, the frequency distribution of the occurrence of the katabatic flow over one year period is studied along the characteristics of the flow arriving in the neighbouring urban area at a distance of 1.5 km. It was found that the katabatic flow occurs mainly in autumn and spring with the highest frequency in April. The flow is generally characterised by small depth as it is affected substantially by the background flow. The expected direction of the katabatic wind dominates mainly at the level of 7 m, where the influence of the background flow is minimised. At the level of 18 m the wind direction shifts, due to the interaction of the katabatic wind with the background flow. The katabatic flow can penetrate at a distance of 1.5 km being substantially weakened.",

Some studies have clarified that katabatic winds are stronger on steep slopes, while others have demonstrated that katabatic winds are stronger on gentle slopes. Here, we explore the control mechanisms of katabatic flow using a simplified theoretical model in an attempt to clarify the causes of the paradoxical findings. Our results indicate that optimal conditions for katabatic flows within canopies are synergistically controlled by terrain angle, canopy structure and thermal condition through a simple equation \\documentclass{article}\\usepackage{amsmath}\\usepackage{amssymb}\\usepackage{amsbsy}\\usepackage{amsfonts}\\pagestyle{empty}\\begin{document}$L_{{\\mathrm c}} V_T^{-2} \\sin^{3}\\alpha = b$ \\end{document}, where α is terrain slope, L<SUB>c</SUB> = 1/(c<SUB>D</SUB>a) is canopy length-scale, c<SUB>D</SUB> is drag coefficient, a is leaf area density, V<SUB>T</SUB> = R<SUB>c</SUB>/γ is a thermal factor, R<SUB>c</SUB> is a cooling rate, γ is ambient lapse rate, and b is a constant.

Nonetheless, glacier valleys control katabatic winds in this region, and the latter are thought to affect the climate of the Ross Sea sector, frsater formation to snow mass balance. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the production of turbulent kinetic energy by the subgrid-scale orography in the Transantarctic Mountains using a 20-km atmospheric regional model. A classical orographic roughness length parametrization is modified to produce either smooth or rough valleys. A one-year simulation shows that katabatic winds in the Transantarctic Mountains are strongly improved using smooth valleys rather than rough valleys. Pressure and temperature fields are affected by the representation of the orographic roughness, specifically in the Transantarctic Mountains and over the Ross Ice Shelf. A smooth representation of escarpment regions shows better agreement with automatic weather station observations than a rough representation. This work stresses the need to improve the representation of subgrid-scale orography to simulate realistic katabatic flows. This paper also provides a way of improving surface winds in an atmospheric model without increasing its resolution.",

      "abstract": "Complex interactions between katabatic winds and the cryosphere may lead to the formation of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named snow megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, subsurface radar soundings and spectroscopic data acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves have similarities with Antarctic snow megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size asymmetry, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Both sets of Martian sedimentation waves present young ice and occasional sastrugi fields, indicative of net accumulation, on their shallow-dipping upwind sides, their tops and the intervening troughs. Old layers of dusty ice, indicative of net ablation, are exhumed on the steep-dipping downwind sides of the larger waves. Smooth surfaces of coarse-grained ice, indicative of reduced accumulation associated with sublimation metamorphism, cover the steep-dipping downwind sides of the smaller waves. These surface characteristics and the internal stratigraphy revealed by radar soundings are consistent with the interpretation that both sets of Martian sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. The recognition of these sedimentation waves provides the basis for the development of a common model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of Martian and terrestrial glaciers. Martian smaller waves, characterized by reduced net accumulation on their downwind sides, are analogous to Antarctic snow megadunes that have been described so far. A terrestrial equivalent remains to be discovered for the larger Martian waves, characterized by net ablation on their downwind sides.",

      "abstract": "Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) enhance surface melting and can flex and fracture ice shelves when they grow and subsequently drain, potentially leading to ice shelf disintegration. However, the seasonal evolution of SGLs and their influence on ice shelf stability in East Antarctica remains poorly understood, despite some potentially vulnerable ice shelves having high densities of SGLs. Using optical satellite imagery, air temperature data from climate reanalysis products and surface melt predicted by a regional climate model, we present the first long-term record (2000-2020) of seasonal SGL evolution on Shackleton Ice Shelf, which is Antarctica's northernmost remaining ice shelf and buttresses Denman Glacier, a major outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In a typical melt season, we find hundreds of SGLs with a mean area of 0.02 km<SUP>2</SUP>, a mean depth of 0.96 m and a mean total meltwater volume of 7.45×10<SUP>6</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>. At their most extensive, SGLs cover a cumulative area of 50.7 km<SUP>2</SUP> and are clustered near to the grounding line, where densities approach 0.27 km<SUP>2</SUP> km<SUP>-2</SUP>. Here, SGL development is linked to an albedo-lowering feedback associated with katabatic winds, together with the presence of blue ice and exposed rock. Although below-average seasonal (December-January-February, DJF) temperatures are associated with below-average peaks in total SGL area and volume, warmer seasonal temperatures do not necessarily result in higher SGL areas and volumes. Rather, peaks in total SGL area and volume show a much closer correspondence with short-lived high-magnitude snowmelt events. We therefore suggest seasonal lake evolution on this ice shelf is instead more sensitive to snowmelt intensity associated with katabatic-wind-driven melting. Our analysis provides important constraints on the boundary conditions of supraglacial hydrology models and numerical simulations of ice shelf stability.",

When it occurs the effect of the mountain on the high-level flow is reduced. If the airflow is temporarily induced to follow the ground in an airstream favourable to separation, very large vertical velocities may result. Eddies may be shed periodically from the lee slope of a ridge. Lee waves inhibit separation and so do katabatic winds and downdraughts in heavy rain. Convection makes it more likely over lee slopes but inhibits it at the top of windward slopes.",

      "abstract": "A description of the new air quality downscaling model - the urban EMEP (uEMEP) and its combination with the EMEP MSC-W model (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesising Centre West) - is presented. uEMEP is based on well-known Gaussian modelling principles. The uniqueness of the system is in its combination with the EMEP MSC-W model and the \"local fraction\" calculation contained within it. This allows the uEMEP model to be imbedded in the EMEP MSC-W model and downscaling can be carried out anywhere within the EMEP model domain, without any double counting of emissions, if appropriate proxy data are available that describe the spatial distribution of the emissions. This makes the model suitable for high-resolution calculations, down to 50 m, over entire countries. An example application, the Norwegian air quality forecasting and assessment system, is described where the entire country is modelled at a resolution of between 250 and 50 m. The model is validated against all available monitoring data, including traffic sites, in Norway. The results of the validation show good results for NO<SUB>2</SUB>, which has the best known emissions, and moderately good for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>. In Norway, the largest contributor to PM, even in cities, is long-range transport followed by road dust and domestic heating emissions. These contributors to PM are more difficult to quantify than NO<SUB>x</SUB> exhaust emission from traffic, which is the major contributor to NO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. In addition to the validation results, a number of verification and sensitivity results are summarised. One verification showed that single annual mean calculations with a rotationally symmetric dispersion kernel give very similar results to the average of an entire year of hourly calculations, reducing the runtime for annual means by 4 orders of magnitude. The uEMEP model, in combination with EMEP MSC-W model, provides a new tool for assessing local-scale concentrations and exposure over large regions in a consistent and homogenous way and is suitable for large-scale policy applications.",

The method is based on the use of multiwell plates (Biolog®) for producing concentration versus effect relationships for (maximally) 95 different microbial metabolic activities. For this, artificial exposure in the multiwell plate is established to the contaminant supposedly causing toxic effects in the field. The method was tested in a gradient of zinc‑contaminated field plots by studying community tolerance to zinc. For most substrates the metabolic activities showed an increased community tolerance for zinc with increased zinc concentration in the field. Consequently, PICT has evolved after 2.5 years of zinc exposure under field conditions. The perspectives for future use of the PICT concept in combination with the multiwell technique for demonstrating ecotoxicological effects at contaminated sites is exemplified by the comparison of Dutch soil quality criteria for zinc with the collected data. This comparison showed that the evolution of microbial‑PICT for zinc has occurred at environmental concentrations near the Dutch intervention value, a quality criterion linked to remediation urgency.",

The nucleation and growth of W ALD on hydroxylated Al2O3 ALD surfaces and Al2O3 ALD on fluorinated W ALD surfaces was studied using in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and ex situ atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques. The QCM investigations revealed that Al2O3 ALD readily nucleated on the fluorinated W surface and displayed \"substrate-enhanced growth.\" In contrast, W ALD required 4-10 ALD cycles to nucleate on the hydroxylated Al2O3 surface and displayed \"substrate-inhibited growth.\" The W ALD nucleation period was shorter for higher Si2H6 and WF6 reactant exposures. The most rapid nucleation of W ALD on the Al2O3 surface occurred with much larger Si2H6 and WF6 exposures on the initial ALD cycle with the WF6 exposure prior to the Si2H6 exposure. By analyzing the individual Si2H6 and WF6 mass gain per cycle (MGPC), three main regions were identified in the W ALD nucleation and growth: initial deposition on Al2O3, W island growth and coalescence, and steady state growth. The root mean square (rms) roughness of the resulting W ALD film was dependent on the Si2H6 exposures and the number of ALD cycles required to nucleate the W ALD. A linear dependence was observed between the rms roughness and the number of ALD cycles required to reach one-half the maximum W MGPC. The W ALD also displayed very periodic oscillations in the W MGPC that were consistent with island nucleation and growth. Four local minima and three local maxima were observed in the W MGPC versus the number of ALD cycles. Comparing the results for W ALD on Al2O3 surfaces with recent simulations of ALD nucleation helps to establish the relationship between the nucleation period and surface roughness with island growth during nucleation.",

Seasonal changes in cambial potassium content, osmotic potential, and cambial activity correlated strongly throughout the season, increasing from spring to summer and decreasing from summer to autumn. Moreover, changing the potassium supply during the growing season affected the seasonal changes of these parameters in a similar way. Low potassium supply markedly reduced cambial activity, the number of expanding cambial cell derivatives, the seasonal rate of radial wood increment, and the vessel frequency. The possible effect of hormones on potassium-dependent cambial growth was investigated and revealed that abscisic acid (ABA) strongly decreased the potassium content within the cambial zone and reduced cambial activity, as well as the number of expanding cambial cell derivatives. In summary, our results indicate a key role for potassium in the regulation of cambial growth and wood formation due to its strong impact on osmoregulation in expanding cambial cells. They also demonstrate involvement of ABA in regulation of potassium-dependent cambial growth.",

Washed excised rice roots showed sulfate reduction potential when incubated in anaerobic medium indicating the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Rice plants, that were incubated in a double-chamber (phylloshpere and rhizosphere separated), showed potential sulfate reduction rates in the anoxic rhizosphere compartment. These rates decreased when oxygen was allowed to penetrate through the aerenchyma system of the plants into the anoxic root compartment, indicating that sulfate reducers on the roots were partially inhibited by oxygen or that sulfate was regenerated by oxidation of reduced S-compounds. The potential activity of sulfate reducers on rice roots was consistent with MPN enumerations showing that H <SUB>2</SUB>-utilizing sulfate-reducing bacteria were present in high numbers on the rhizoplane (4.1×10 <SUP>7</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP> root fresh weight) and in the adjacent rhizosperic soil (2.5×10 <SUP>7</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP> soil dry weight). Acetate-oxidizing sulfate reducers, on the other hand, showed highest numbers in the unplanted bulk soil (1.9×10 <SUP>6</SUP> g <SUP>-1</SUP> soil dry weight). Two sulfate reducing bacteria were isolated from the highest dilutions of the MPN series and were characterized physiologically and phylogenetically. Strain F1-7b which was isolated from the rhizoplane with H <SUB>2</SUB> as electron donor was related to subgroup II of the family Desulfovibrionaceae. Strain EZ-2C2, isolated from the rhizoplane on acetate, grouped together with Desulforhabdus sp. and Syntrophobacter wolinii. Other strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria originated from bulk soil of rice soil microcosms and were isolated using different electron donors. From these isolates, strains R-AcA1, R-IbutA1, R-PimA1 and R-AcetonA170 were Gram-positive bacteria which were affiliated with the genus Desulfotomaculum. The other isolates were members of subgroup II of the Desulfovibrionaceae ( R-SucA1 and R-LacA1), were related to Desulforhabdus sp.

      "abstract": "The Free-Electron Laser (FEL) FLASH offers the worldwide still unique capability to study ultrafast processes with high-flux, high-repetition rate extreme ultraviolet, and soft X-ray pulses. The vast majority of experiments at FLASH are of pump-probe type. Many of them rely on optical ultrafast lasers. Here, a novel FEL facility laser is reported which combines high average power output from Yb:YAG amplifiers with spectral broadening in a Herriott-type multipass cell and subsequent pulse compression to sub-100-fs durations. Compared to other facility lasers employing optical parametric amplification, the new system comes with significantly improved noise figures, compactness, simplicity, and power efficiency. Like FLASH, the optical laser operates with 10-Hz burst repetition rate. The bursts consist of 800-μs long trains of up to 800 ultrashort pulses being synchronized to the FEL with femtosecond precision. In the experimental chamber, pulses with up to 50-μJ energy, 60-fs full-width half-maximum duration and 1-MHz rate at 1.03-μm wavelength are available and can be adjusted by computer-control. Moreover, nonlinear polarization rotation is implemented to improve laser pulse contrast. First cross-correlation measurements with the FEL at the plane-grating monochromator photon beamline are demonstrated, exhibiting the suitability of the laser for user experiments at FLASH.",

      "abstract": "In the interior of the Antarctic ice sheet the surface temperature inversion averages over 25°C in the winter months. The negative buoyancy of the near-surface air drives the katabatic windflow, which has important consequences for the climate of Antarctica. Radiosonde measurements of the inversion are combined with recent GCM results in an attempt to assess the accuracy of proposed connections between the surface temperature and the inversion strength by comparing the limited observational verification data with the much wider coverage that a climate model allows. This indicates that, using multi-annual data, the continent-wide RMS error of deducing the inversion strength from a regression technique is approximately 29°C, whereas using a method based upon differences between summer and winter temperaures has a RMS error of approximately 25°C.",

      "abstract": "Circulation and water mass transformation within the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) cavity create precursors to Antarctic bottom water, which closes the global overturning circulation. This water mass transformation is contingent upon a relative low rate of FRIS basal melt, currently around 100-200 Gt/yr. Previous studies have indicated that Antarctic climate changes may induce intrusions of warm modified Warm Deep Water (mWDW) and an order-of-magnitude increase in basal melt, and signatures of mWDW have recently been observed along the face of the FRIS. However, it remains unclear how changes in near-Antarctic climate translate mechanistically to changes in mWDW access to the FRIS cavity. In this study a regional model is developed to investigate FRIS circulation dependence on local atmospheric state. Experiments with modified initial cavity conditions but identical atmospheric states yield bistable \"warm\" and \"cold\" FRIS cavity states, with an order-of-magnitude difference in basal melt rates. Idealized atmospheric perturbation experiments reveal that relatively modest perturbations to the katabatic winds shift the FRIS cavity between \"warm\" and \"cold\" states, which occur when the FRIS cavity is filled by mWDW or High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), respectively. The authors present a conceptual model in which the FRIS cavity state is determined by whether mWDW or HSSW is denser and thus floods the cavity; these states are bistable because the basal melt rate feeds back on the salinity of HSSW. These findings highlight a key role for the katabatic winds in mediating the melt of the FRIS and other Antarctic ice shelves.",

      "abstract": "The atmospheric surface layer of high-altitude tropical glaciers is inadequately understood, particularly concerning turbulent fluxes. Measurements have shown that sublimation reduces melt energy in the dry season, but the errors are large when a katabatic wind maximum occurs at a low height. This study analyzed wind and temperature vertical profiles measured by a 6 m mast in the ablation area of the tropical Zongo glacier (16°S, 5060 m above sea level) in the dry seasons of 2005 and 2007. Surface roughness lengths for momentum and temperature were derived from least squares fits of hourly wind and temperature profile data. Measurement errors were explored, focusing on the poorly defined reference level for sensor heights. A katabatic wind maximum at heights between 2 and 3 m was regularly observed during low wind speed and strong inversion conditions, or about 50%of the time, greatly reducing the surface layer depth. The glacier surface, experiencing melting conditions in the early afternoon and strong cooling at night, remained relatively smooth with z<SUB>0</SUB> 1 mm and z<SUB>T</SUB> 0.1 mm. Sensible heat flux measured at 1 m was not very sensitive to the zero reference level due to two opposite effects: when measurement heights increase, profile-derived roughness lengths increase but temperature and wind gradients decrease. The relation between z<SUB>T</SUB>/z<SUB>0</SUB> and the roughness Reynolds number Re<SUB>*</SUB> roughly agrees with the surface renewal model. However, this is mostly due to self-correlation because of the shared variable z<SUB>0</SUB> in z<SUB>T</SUB>/z<SUB>0</SUB> and Re<SUB>*</SUB>, which prevents a sound experimental validation of the model.",

      "abstract": "The martian North Polar layered deposits (NPLD) are composed of alternating water-ice and dust-rich layers resulting from atmospheric deposition and are key to understanding Mars climate cycles. Within these deposits are spiral troughs whose migration affects deposition signals. To understand the relationship between NPLD stratigraphy and Martian climate, we must identify modern-day drivers of NPLD ice migration. Prevailing theory posits migration driven by upstream-migrating bed undulations bounded by hydraulic jumps, caused by katabatic winds flowing over trough walls with asymmetric cross-sectional relief. This is supported by trough-parallel clouds, whose formation has been attributed to hydraulic jumps. We present a cloud atlas across the Martian north pole using ∼13,800 THEMIS images spanning ∼18 Earth years. We find trough-parallel clouds in ∼400 images, with regions nearer to the pole having higher cloud frequency. We compare spiral trough geometry to our cloud atlas and find regions with trough-parallel clouds often correlate with metrics associated with modern-day sublimation-deposition cycles (i.e., relief and asymmetry), but not always. In some regions, troughs with morphologies conducive to cloud formation have no clouds. Overall, trough geometry varies greatly across the deposits, both within and between troughs, suggesting localized differences in deposition relative to migration, varying katabatic wind intensities, differing past climatic states influencing the troughs, varying trough initiation properties, or the possibility of additional mechanisms for trough initiation and migration (e.g., in situ trough erosion). Understanding what controls trough shape variability across the NPLD and how these controls change through time and space is key when interpreting Martian paleoclimate.",

      "abstract": "Output from the regional climate model RACMO2/ANT is used to calculate the heat budget of the Antarctic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The main feature of the wintertime Antarctic ABL is a persistent temperature deficit compared to the free atmosphere. The magnitude of this deficit is controlled by the heat budget. During winter, transport of heat towards the surface by turbulence and net longwave emission are the primary ABL cooling terms. These processes show horizontal spatial variability only on continental scales. Vertical and horizontal, i.e. along-slope, advection of heat are the main warming terms. Over regions with convex ice sheet topography, i.e. domes and ridges, warming by downward vertical advection is enhanced due to divergence of the ABL wind field. Horizontal advection balances excess warming caused by vertical advection, hence the temperature deficit in the ABL weakens over domes and ridges along the prevailing katabatic wind. Conversely, vertical advection is reduced in regions with concave topography, i.e. valleys, where the ABL temperature deficit enlarges along the katabatic wind. Along the coast, horizontal and vertical advection is governed by the inability of the large-scale circulation to adapt to small scale topographic features. Meso-scale topographic structures have thus a strong impact on the ABL winter temperature, besides latitude and surface elevation. During summer, this mechanism is much weaker, and the horizontal variability of ABL temperatures is smaller.",

      "abstract": "Direct measurements of sensible heat fluxes on glaciers are rare due to the sensitive instrumentation required. Instead, heat fluxes are often parameterized using bulk aerodynamic methods, which have been shown to perform poorly in the presence of katabatic winds with wind speed maxima near the glacier surface. When eddy-covariance measurements are available, multiresolution flux decomposition establishes the spectral gap and determines the mean window for covariance calculation. In this study, we obtain 57 days of continuous meteorological measurements and turbulent fluxes at three heights (1m, 2m, 3m) on Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Yukon, Canada. Since the observed near-surface wind speed and temperature vary significantly over the observational period, we find that a single decomposition window length is not appropriate for covariance calculation for all flow conditions. We propose a flexible flux calculation method that conforms to flow characteristics using change point detection (CPD). The methods are then used to construct height-independent filtering criteria which ensure measured fluxes are representative of surface conditions. Combined with a hockey stick model of friction velocity, which captures the sharp change between stable and neutral regimes, the new criteria significantly reduce bias and scatter of modelled heat fluxes compared to conventional bulk aerodynamic models. We extend this methodology to low-frequency measurements by identifying windows of opportunity when fluxes can be accurately modelled. These techniques improve models of heat fluxes using temperature probes and wind propellors when eddy covariance instruments cannot be installed. CPD also reveals a sharp temperature gradient at the katabatic wind speed maximum, suggesting that shallow katabatics maintain a thin layer of insulating cold air near the glacier surface.",

      "abstract": "The present study describes simulations of thermal flows in Iceland during a day of strong radiative surface cooling. The thermal flows are organized by the topography as well as the differential cooling of the land and the sea. Idealized simulations reveal that there is strong land breeze at the coast. This land breeze has previously been referred to as \"katabatic wind\" which is in many cases considerably weaker than the land breeze and is created in the sloping topography. The topography: • gives rise to the katabatic winds which sometimes merge with the land breeze and • reduces or eliminates the land breeze in many coastal regions • contributes to channeling of the winds and a stronger ageostrophic component of the coastal winds. • gives rise to strong cyclonic flow aloft through a deformation of the temperature field (adiabatic warming) over the mountains. This flow is as much as ten times deeper than the katabatic winds and the land breeze at the surface. The katabatic winds weaken and cease to exist if the land breeze, or possibly other background flows, do not constantly remove the stagnant cold air at lower levels. When the cold pool deepens the driving force behind the katabatic flows weakens, i.e. the horizontal temperature gradient above the mountain slopes. A \"peninsula\"-effect contributes to a sheltering on the left hand hand side of peninsulas and an acceleration of the flow on the right hand side when looking from the sea towards land. This reflects the analogous results of a similar study of thermal winds in Iceland during a day of strong surface heating",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the distribution, character and age of blue-ice moraines in Antarctica and asks whether there are implications for the study of former Pleistocene ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Blue-ice forms where acceleration of downslope katabatic winds removes snow and causes ice to ablate. Upward ice flow compensates for the surface ablation and in some places brings rock debris to the surface to form a blue-ice moraine. Blue-ice moraines occur where topography focuses katabatic winds, notably outlet glaciers cutting through mountains and in the lee of nunataks and escarpments nearer the coast. Many Antarctic blue-ice moraines have been accumulating for millions of years. The cyclic growth and decay of Pleistocene ice sheets and the dominance of surface ablation near the ice-sheet margins are clearly different, yet there are aspects that apply to Pleistocene ice sheets. Based on Antarctic blue-ice deposits, equivalent deposits associated with former Pleistocene ice sheets are likely to: (1) lie in topographic sediment traps such as in side valleys or embayments next to outlet glaciers, (2) occur in the lee of mountains, (3) display a morphology indicating ice flow into the embayment or towards the mountain front, (4) include a wide range of lithologies derived from the inland ice sheet, yet consist wholly of local debris in places, (5) accumulate a thick deposit perhaps over successive glaciations. Further, (6) the location and intensity of moraine formation will change spatially and vertically in response to changes in the relative elevation of the surrounding mountains and its effect on ice flow. The extent to which these criteria will help in interpreting the behaviour of Pleistocene ice sheets is uncertain. But we use examples from the Greenland, Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheets to suggest that the concept of enhanced ablation by katabatic winds encouraging surface moraine formation helps resolve several puzzles.",

The heat storage process is based on a reversible adsorption-desorption reaction, which is exothermic in one direction (hydration) and endothermic in the reverse direction (dehydration). For evaluating the transport phenomena occurring in a heat storage reactor, a detailed model is needed, considering also the transversal terms. In a cylindrical reactor, these terms appear as radial effects that disturb the plug flow assumption in the packed bed, and hence, a model with only axial terms is insufficient to simulate the bed. The radial effects in a porous medium, created by presence of the wall surrounding it, can be caused by: (i) heat losses to the ambient through the wall, (ii) a higher bed void fraction in the wall region, resulting in flow channelling, and (iii) non-uniform initial state of charge near the wall for the subsequent re/de-hydration (e.g. due to heat loss during dehydration). A 2D model is developed for transport phenomena in a packed bed by doing a literature survey on representative models. The model is validated by experimental results measured in a lab-scale setup by comparing the pressure drop over the bed, velocity profile below the bed and temperature profile inside the bed. In addition, the concentration of adsorbed water is compared with experimental results from MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) experiments. The validated numerical model is employed to understand the significance of the above mentioned effects on the thermal performance of the reactor. An accurate model for the thermal dynamics of an adsorption bed on reactor scale is obtained, which is used to present suggestions to optimize the charging and discharging process times, hence, to improve the performance of the reactor.",

      "abstract": "Recently a triarylmethyl-based (TAM) radical has been developed for research in biological and other aqueous systems, and in low magnetic fields, 10 mT or less, large <SUP>1</SUP>H dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhancements have been reported. In this paper the DNP properties of this radical have been investigated in a considerably larger field of 1.4 T, corresponding to proton and electron Larmor frequencies of 60 MHz and 40 GHz, respectively. To avoid excessive microwave heating of the sample, an existing DNP NMR probe was modified with a screening coil, wound around the sample capillary and with its axis perpendicular to the electric component of the microwave field. It was found that with this probe the temperature increase in the sample after 4 s of microwave irradiation with an incident power of 10 W was only 16°C. For the investigations, 10 mM of the TAM radical was dissolved in deionized, but not degassed, water and put into a 1-mm i.d. and 6-mm long capillary tube. At 26°C the following results were obtained: (I) The relaxivity of the radical is 0.07 (mMs)<SUP>-1</SUP>, in accordance with the value extrapolated from low-field results; (II) The leakage factor is 0.63, the saturation factor at maximum power is 0.85, and the coupling factor is -0.0187. It is shown that these results agree very well with an analysis where the electron-dipolar interactions are the dominant DNP mechanism, and where the relaxation transitions resulting from these interactions are governed by translational diffusion of the water molecules. Finally, the possibilities of combining DNP with magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) are discussed. It is shown that at 26°C the overall DNP-enhanced proton polarization should become maximal in an external field of 0.3 T and become comparable to the thermal equilibrium polarization in a field of 30 T, considerably larger than the largest high-resolution magnet available to date. It is concluded that DNP MRM in this field, which corresponds to a standard microwave frequency of 9 GHz, has the potential to significantly increase the sensitivity in NMR and MRI experiments of small aqueous samples doped with the TAM radical.",

The results show that OE-IR cloud optical thickness (τ) and effective radius (r<SUB>eff</SUB>) retrievals perform best for ice clouds having 0.5 &lt; τ &lt; 7 and r<SUB>eff</SUB> &lt; 50 µm. For global ice clouds, the averaged retrieval uncertainties of τ and r<SUB>eff</SUB> are 19% and 33%, respectively. For optically thick ice clouds with τ larger than 10, however, the τ and r<SUB>eff</SUB> retrieval uncertainties can exceed 30% and 50%, respectively. For ice cloud top height (h), the averaged global uncertainty is 0.48 km. Relatively large h uncertainty (e.g., &gt; 1 km) occurs for τ &lt; 0.5. Analysis of 1 month of the OE-IR retrievals shows large τ and r<SUB>eff</SUB> uncertainties in storm track regions and the southern oceans where convective clouds are frequently observed, as well as in high-latitude regions where temperature differences between the surface and cloud top are more ambiguous. Generally, comparisons between the OE-IR and the operational products show consistent τ and h retrievals.

In this study we aim to explore whether the modelling system based on the WRF and EMEP models could be used in air pollution management in Eastern Europe. Secondly, we plan to present the role of emission data in air pollution modelling through the use of two databases: 1) TNO MACC III covering Europe; and 2) TNO MACC III, supported with a high resolution local database for domestic combustion and road transport. In general, the performance of the EMEP4PL model is satisfactory for air quality assessment. The improvement of the model results after the incorporation of high resolution information concerning emissions is dependent on the seasons.",

By using an integrated formula for flow velocity errors due to averaging two conductivity values are avoided. This confines the applicability to situations in which the soil is not too dry. The model also simulates the drainage process. So it produces the depth of the groundwater table and the discharge data. Other output data are pool depth, runoff, flow velocity at every depth, moisture content and tension for every layer. A discussion is given on the errors caused by averaging conductivity values in models. A chapter is dealing with oscillations caused by too large time steps. The time steps must be chosen in such a way that errors will not be amplified but reduced. The last chapter gives the costs of computation. For soils with low permeability the model seems to be very cheap to run. A digital model as the one described is fit for short runs with many soils. For long runs with one soil an analogous model is more appropriate.",

In vivo, the extracellular matrix is composed of fibrous arrays. To understand the fibre geometries that are required for adhesion formation, we patterned nanolines of various line widths and arrangements in single, crossing or paired arrays with the integrin-binding peptide Arg-Gly-Asp. Single thin lines (width ≤30 nm) did not support cell spreading or formation of focal adhesions, despite the presence of a high density of Arg-Gly-Asp, but wide lines (&gt;40 nm) did. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed stable, dense integrin clusters formed on parallel (within 110 nm) or crossing thin lines (mimicking a matrix mesh) similar to those on continuous substrates. These dense clusters bridged the line pairs by recruiting activated but unliganded integrins, as verified by integrin mutants unable to bind ligands that coclustered with ligand-bound integrins when present in an active extended conformation. Thus, in a fibrous extracellular matrix mesh, stable integrin nanoclusters bridge between thin (≤30 nm) matrix fibres and bring about downstream consequences of cell motility and growth.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric pollution has many profound effects on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Of concern are high concentrations and deposition of reactive nitrogen (N<SUB>r</SUB>) species, especially of reduced N (gaseous NH<SUB>3</SUB>, particulate <SUP>NH<SUB>4</SUB>+</SUP>). Atmospheric chemistry and transport models (ACTMs) are crucial to understanding sources and impacts of N<SUB>r</SUB> chemistry and its potential mitigation. Here we undertake the first evaluation of the global version of the EMEP MSC-W ACTM driven by WRF meteorology (1°×1° resolution), with a focus on surface concentrations and wet deposition of N and S species relevant to investigation of atmospheric N<SUB>r</SUB> and secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). The model-measurement comparison is conducted both spatially and temporally, covering 10 monitoring networks worldwide. Model simulations for 2010 compared use of both HTAP and ECLIPSE<SUB>E</SUB> (ECLIPSE annual total with EDGAR monthly profile) emissions inventories; those for 2015 used ECLIPSE<SUB>E</SUB> only. Simulations of primary pollutants are somewhat sensitive to the choice of inventory in places where regional differences in primary emissions between the two inventories are apparent (e.g. China) but are much less sensitive for secondary components. For example, the difference in modelled global annual mean surface NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentration using the two 2010 inventories is 18 % (HTAP: 0.26 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP>; ECLIPSE<SUB>E</SUB>: 0.31 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP>) but is only 3.5 % for <SUP>NH<SUB>4</SUB>+</SUP> (HTAP: 0.316 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP>; ECLIPSE<SUB>E</SUB>: 0.305 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP>). Comparisons of 2010 and 2015 surface concentrations between the model and measurements demonstrate that the model captures the overall spatial and seasonal variations well for the major inorganic pollutants NH<SUB>3</SUB>, NO<SUB>2</SUB>, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, HNO<SUB>3</SUB>, <SUP>NH<SUB>4</SUB>+</SUP>, <SUP>NO<SUB>3</SUB>-</SUP>, and <SUP>SO<SUB>4</SUB>2-</SUP> and their wet deposition in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America. The model shows better correlations with annual average measurements for networks in Southeast Asia (mean R for seven species: R<SUB>7</SUB>‾=0.73), Europe (R<SUB>7</SUB>‾=0.67), and North America (R<SUB>7</SUB>‾=0.63) than in East Asia (R<SUB>5</SUB>‾=0.35) (data for 2015), which suggests potential issues with the measurements in the latter network. Temporally, both model and measurements agree on higher NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations in spring and summer and lower concentrations in winter. The model slightly underestimates annual total precipitation measurements (by 13 %-45 %) but agrees well with the spatial variations in precipitation in all four world regions (0.65-0.94 R range). High correlations between measured and modelled <SUP>NH<SUB>4</SUB>+</SUP> precipitation concentrations are also observed in all regions except East Asia. For annual total wet deposition of reduced N, the greatest consistency is in North America (0.75-0.82 R range), followed by Southeast Asia (R=0.68) and Europe (R=0.61). Model-measurement bias varies between species in different networks; for example, bias for <SUP>NH<SUB>4</SUB>+</SUP> and <SUP>NO<SUB>3</SUB>-</SUP> is largest in Europe and North America and smallest in East Asia and Southeast Asia. The greater uniformity in spatial correlations than in biases suggests that the major driver of model-measurement discrepancies (aside from differing spatial representativeness and uncertainties and biases in measurements) are shortcomings in absolute emissions rather than in modelling the atmospheric processes. The comprehensive evaluations presented in this study support the application of this model framework for global analysis of current and potential future budgets and deposition of N<SUB>r</SUB> and SIA.",

The cost trends of the individual components in the electric drive train are a central aspect of the future market success of the different vehicle drive systems. An innovative two-factor experience curve approach was developed to facilitate the generation of the most meaningful cost forecasts for these components. This enables the creation of a flexible cost forecast model that supplements the two-factor experience curve approach by an analogous technology component. The performance of the model was demonstrated using alternative drive components, namely the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack, a high energy lithium-ion battery and a high power lithium-ion battery. A comparison of the forecast values calculated using this model with the industry targets determined by McKinsey in the study \"A portfolio of power-trains for Europe\"[1] shows that the realization of these targets for the fuel cell stack is possible if the product volume increases rapidly enough. For the high energy and high power lithium-ion battery targets, the product volume and research and development activity, measured here in terms of patent growth, need to grow compared to the trend of the last years.",

By adopting a [8s, 4p, 2d] uncontracted Gaussian type basis set and the numerical model EXRHF3, the total electronic energy has been calculated for 16 different internuclear distances from 3 to 12 au, and 7 relative orientations for each distance. An isotropic well depth of 98.3 μhartree is obtained. The most reliable experimental estimate of the well depth is 108 μhartree. An estimaton of the errors due to basis set superposition error, truncation erros related to the electron correlation approach, adoption of an incomplete basis set, and the rigid rotor approximation, yields roughly 6 μhartree. It is argued that the residual difference, between the semi-experimental potentials and the ab initio potential is likely to have its origin in the regularising assumption used for the former.",

The GREAT-ER approach combines a series of well-studied models (for sewers, waste water treatment plants and rivers) with spatial information managed by a GIS. A new version of GREAT-ER (version 2) has been developed which has a number of improved features compared to its predecessor. All components are now implemented as Free Software and make use of Free Software where possible. This simplifies the distribution, use and extension of the system and its components for scientific applications. In addition, two new platform-independent user interfaces have been developed. The first is a simplified web-based interface for easy access without installation and the second is a full-featured desktop version. The model system has been re-designed to increase its flexibility for the modification and extension of its component models. In addition, the file-based data storage system used in version 1 has been replaced by a database management system with a flexible Application Programming Interface (API). This makes it easier for users to share their results, using a new repository (also with web-based and desktop versions) serving as a central communication tool. The output from the new system has been successfully tested against the field-validated models in GREAT-ER 1.0.",

Acute Daphnia magna toxicity tests for binary mixtures indicate that mixtures are more toxic than the individual AE substances corresponding with their average structures (due to the nonlinear relation of toxicity with structure). Consequently, the ecotoxicity value (expressed as effects concentration) attributed to the average structures that are used to develop the existing QSARs is expected to be too low. A new QSAR technique for complex substances, which interprets the mixture toxicity with regard to the \"ethoxymers\" distribution (i.e., the individual AE components) rather than the average structure, was developed. This new technique was then applied to develop new AE ecotoxicity QSARs for invertebrates, fish, and mesocosms. Despite the higher complexity, the fit and accuracy of the new QSARs are at least as good as those for the existing QSARs based on the same data set. As expected from typical ethoxymer distributions of commercial AEs, the new QSAR generally predicts less toxicity than the QSARs based on average structure.",

Using tools borrowed from the evaluation of ensemble weather forecasting, we analyze statistics of simulated ensembles of ozone daily maxima over an entire summer season. Although the model ensemble overestimates ozone, the distribution of simulated concentrations is representative of the uncertainty. The spread of simulations is due to random fluctuations resulting from differences in model formulations and input data, but also to the spread between individual model systematic biases. The ensemble average skill increases as the spread decreases. The skill of the ensemble in giving probabilistic predictions of threshold exceedances is also demonstrated. These results allow for optimism about the ability of this ensemble to simulate the uncertainty of the impact of emission control scenarios.",

These cloud products, having heritage with the NASA Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD06 cloud optical properties product and the NOAA GOES-R Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Cloud Height Algorithm (ACHA), represent an effort to bridge the multispectral imager records of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA's current generation of operational weather satellites to achieve a continuous, multi-decadal climate data record for clouds that can extend well into the 2030s. CLDPROP offers a \"continuity of approach,\" applying common algorithms and ancillary datasets to both MODIS and VIIRS, including utilizing only a subset of spectral channels available on both sensors to help mitigate instrument differences. The initial release of the CLDPROP_MODIS and CLDPROP_VIIRS data records spans the SNPP observational record (2012-present). Here, we present an overview of the algorithms and an evaluation of the intersensor continuity of the core CLDPROP_MODIS and CLDPROP_VIIRS cloud optical property datasets, i.e., cloud thermodynamic phase, optical thickness, effective particle size, and derived water path. The evaluation includes analyses of pixel-level MODIS/VIIRS co-locations as well as spatial and temporal aggregated statistics, with a focus on identifying and understanding the root causes of individual dataset discontinuities. The results of this evaluation will inform future updates to the CLDPROP products and help scientific users determine the appropriate use of the product datasets for their specific needs.",

      "abstract": "The performance of time-resolved photoemission experiments at fs-pulsed photon sources is ultimately limited by the e-e Coulomb interaction, downgrading energy and momentum resolution. Here, we present an approach to effectively suppress space-charge artifacts in momentum microscopes and photoemission microscopes. A retarding electrostatic field generated by a special objective lens repels slow electrons, retaining the k-image of the fast photoelectrons. The suppression of space-charge effects scales with the ratio of the photoelectron velocities of fast and slow electrons. Fields in the range from −20 to −1100 V/mm for E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 100 eV to 4 keV direct secondaries and pump-induced slow electrons back to the sample surface. Ray tracing simulations reveal that this happens within the first 40 to 3 μm above the sample surface for E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 100 eV to 4 keV. An optimized front-lens design allows switching between the conventional accelerating and the new retarding mode. Time-resolved experiments at E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 107 eV using fs extreme ultraviolet probe pulses from the free-electron laser FLASH reveal that the width of the Fermi edge increases by just 30 meV at an incident pump fluence of 22 mJ/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (retarding field −21 V/mm). For an accelerating field of +2 kV/mm and a pump fluence of only 5 mJ/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, it increases by 0.5 eV (pump wavelength 1030 nm). At the given conditions, the suppression mode permits increasing the slow-electron yield by three to four orders of magnitude. The feasibility of the method at high energies is demonstrated without a pump beam at E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 3830 eV using hard x rays from the storage ring PETRA III. The approach opens up a previously inaccessible regime of pump fluences for photoemission experiments.",

Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.

      "abstract": "In some areas of the world, there are certain patterns of airflow which are created as a result of the interaction between different environmental factors. This study is trying to introduce one of these specific patterns that emerges particularly in closed and semi-closed deserts, especially in the arid and semi-arid areas. This phenomenon is highly influenced by the mountain-plain wind systems and that is defined as \"morning cyclone.\" In addition to \"NOAA/AVHRR\" satellite images, the ERA-interim reanalysis data are used as the main data in this study. The morning cyclone has been studied in the Taklamakan Desert in the northwest of China, and the Margo Desert in Afghanistan. The common feature of these two deserts is being surrounded by high mountains. This feature, alongside with some climatic characteristics such as air aridity, influences the formation of morning cyclones. The results of this study demonstrate the formation mechanisms of these cyclones. According to these mechanisms, morning cyclones form when the sun rises in the morning, the land surface temperature increases, and the mixed layer grows in mountain-surrounded deserts, while the mountain-plain winds (Katabatic winds) are blowing. As long as katabatic winds are blowing and warming trend continues across the deserts, the morning cyclones continue to exist. However, approaching noon, anabatic winds dominate over the lands and the morning cyclone disappears quickly. In other words, the morning cyclone has a lifetime spanning the hours between sunrise and pre-noon.",

      "abstract": "Five-year seasonal cycle output produced by the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1) with R15 resolution is used to evaluate the ability of the model to simulate the present-day climate of Antarctica. The model results are compared with observed horizontal syntheses and point data.Katabatic winds, surface temperatures over the continent, the circumpolar trough, the vertical motion field, the split jet stream over the Pacific Ocean, and the snowfall accumulation are analyzed. The results show that the CCM1 with R15 resolution can well simulate to some extent the dynamics of Antarctic climate not only for the synoptic scale, but also for some mesoscale features (mesoscale cyclogenesis). This is reflected in the zonal-mean pattern of vertical motion by the presence of two convergence centers. The finding suggests that the CCM1 might also capture the split jet stream over New Zealand in winter, but the evidence is mixed. This is inferred to be due to inadequate simulation of the thermal forcing over high southern latitudes. The CCM1 can also capture the phase and amplitude of the annual and semiannual variation of temperature, sea level pressure, and zonally averaged zonal (E-W) wind. That the CCM1 can simulate some characteristics of the semiannual variation may be due to the improved radiation treatment compared to the earlier CCM0.The most dramatic shortcomings were associated with the model's anomalously large precipitation amounts at high latitudes, which result from the scheme to suppress negative moisture values. The simulations of cloudiness and the atmospheric heat balance are adversely affected. A greatly refined moisture budget scheme is needed to eliminate these problems and may allow the split jet-stream feature over the New Zealand area in winter to be accurately reproduced. A coupled mesoscale-CCM1 model may be needed to adequately simulate the feedback from mesoscale cyclones to synoptic-scale weather systems, and the katabatic wind circulation.",

The resolution in the Antarctic region reaches 100 km. In order to correctly represent the polar climate, it is necessary to implement several modifications in the model physics. These modifications mostly concern the parameterizations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The simulated Antarctic climate is significantly better in the stretched-grid simulation than in the regular-grid control run. The katabatic wind regime is well captured, although the winds may be somewhat too weak. The annual snow accumulation is generally close to the observed values, although local discrepancies between the simulated annual accumulation and observations remain. The simulated continental mean annual accumulation is 16.2 cm y<SUP>-1</SUP>.

      ],
      "abstract": "A 10-year record (1985-1994) of output statistics from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model shows that profound seasonal changes in surface pressure take place over the Antarctic continent. The most pronounced changes occur during the periods straddling the brief Antarctic summer, from September to December and again from January to April. Surface pressures atop the high Antarctic plateau often display changes in excess of 20 hPa during these periods. Temperatures in the lower troposphere also exhibit marked changes during these transitional periods; surface temperature changes during these 3-month periods reach a maximum near 40 K over the high interior of Antarctica. Hydrostatic considerations suggest that the thermal adjustment in the lowest levels of the atmosphere alters the vertical distribution of pressure with height and hence is consistent with the dramatic seasonal surface pressure changes over the elevated Antarctic ice sheets. A strong interplay exists between the thermal forcing and the katabatic wind circulation over the continent. The large seasonal changes in solar insolation reaching the Antarctic ice surface modulate the intensity of the katabatic wind regime and thus the resulting mean meridional circulation between the continent and the subpolar latitudes. It is proposed that the diabatic adjustment in the lower levels of the atmosphere over Antarctica disrupts the mean meridional circulation creating a seasonal mass imbalance and hence surface pressure changes. It is through the meridional transports that the mass and wind fields reach a quasi-equilibrium adjusted state. The seasonal mass movement over Antarctica requires large-scale mass compensation over much of the southern hemisphere and shows that the diabatic influences at the Antarctic surface have far-field impacts.",

      "abstract": "Variations of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> at regional scales are becoming increasingly important in understanding regional carbon budgets, yet the processes that drive them remain relatively unexplored. A simulation was conducted to test a coupled biosphere-atmospheric model (SiB2-RAMS), by comparing with measurements made at the WLEF-TV tower in Wisconsin, and to investigate some of the mechanisms leading to CO<SUB>2</SUB> variability, both on local and regional scales. The simulation was run for a 5-day period from 26 to 30 July 1997. Multiple nested grids were employed, which enabled mesoscale features to be simulated and which resolved small-scale features in the vicinity of the WLEF tower. In many respects the model was successful at simulating observed meteorological variables and CO<SUB>2</SUB> fluxes and concentrations. The two most significant deficiencies were that excessive nighttime cooling occurred on two of the nights and that late afternoon uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> was larger than observed. Results of the simulation suggest that in addition to biological processes causing variations in CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations at the WLEF site other factors, such as small nearby lakes, turbulence induced by vertical wind shear, boundary layer thermals, and clouds, also had significant impacts. These factors add to the difficulty of interpreting CO<SUB>2</SUB> measurements. Regional-scale patterns of CO<SUB>2</SUB> variability caused by meteorological processes were also identified. Katabatic winds had a significant effect by causing respired CO<SUB>2</SUB> to pool in valleys and along the shores of the Great Lakes during the night. Furthermore, a large diurnal cycle of CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration occurred over the lakes, which appeared to be mainly due to the combined action of katabatic winds, ambient winds, and the lake breeze circulation. These results suggest that meteorological processes associated with the complex terrain in this region leads to substantial CO<SUB>2</SUB> advection. Therefore meteorological as well as biological processes are likely to be important causes of regional-scale CO<SUB>2</SUB> variability in the Great Lakes region. A sensitivity test conducted to examine the differences between using a turbulent kinetic energy based subgrid-scale scheme versus a deformation-type subgrid-scale scheme showed advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Our results suggest that continuous records of CO<SUB>2</SUB> variability measured over heterogeneous continental regions must be interpreted with caution because of the impact of mesoscale circulations on the concentration time series.",

This parametric model is derived from the bulk two-layer model of Ball including the surface friction and taking into account the Earth's rotation and the geostrophic wind in the upper layer. This model is validated using the data set (70 soundings) collected during IAGO experiment at D47 (67°24'S, 138°43'E, altitude 1 564m), 110 km inland from the coast of Adélie Land. The parameteric model is then introduced into a GCM which is a spectral global version of the operational numerical weather prediction model used by the French weather service. The most significant effect of the parameterization is a 50 m increase of the geopotential height over the South Pole. The surface temperature at the South Pole increases (2°C) reducing the pole-midlatitude thermal gradient. The westerly circulation at 50° S is slowed down (4m/s at 850 hPa), and the surface pressure at the South Pole increases (4hPa). These results, consistent with an increase of katabatic winds, would however be improved by a better coupling between the parameterization and the GCM boundary layer.",

It is well known that katabatic winds over the slopes of the Antarctic ice sheet are associated with strong LLJs. Barrier winds occurring, e.g., along the Antarctic Peninsula may also show LLJ structures. A few observational studies show that LLJs occur over sea ice regions. We present a model-based climatology of the wind field, of low-level inversions and of LLJs in the Weddell Sea region of the Antarctic for the period 2002-2016. The sensitivity of the LLJ detection on the selection of the wind speed maximum is investigated. The common criterion of an anomaly of at least 2 m/s is extended to a relative criterion of wind speed decrease above and below the LLJ. The frequencies of LLJs are sensitive to the choice of the relative criterion, i.e., if the value for the relative decrease exceeds 15%. The LLJs are evaluated with respect to the frequency distributions of height, speed, directional shear and stability for different regions. LLJs are most frequent in the katabatic wind regime over the ice sheet and in barrier wind regions. During winter, katabatic LLJs occur with frequencies of more than 70% in many areas. Katabatic LLJs show a narrow range of heights (mostly below 200 m) and speeds (typically 10-20 m/s), while LLJs over the sea ice cover a broad range of speeds and heights. LLJs are associated with surface inversions or low-level lifted inversions. LLJs in the katabatic wind and barrier wind regions can last several days during winter. The duration of LLJs is sensitive to the LLJ definition criteria. We propose to use only the absolute criterion for model studies.",

Results of calibration experiments with the monodentate base pyridine and the bidentate base ethylenediamine are presented for which the method provides proton affinities in excellent agreement with published values and reasonable predictions for the protonation entropies. The method is then used to determine the proton affinity and protonation entropy of the non-protein amino acid β-oxalylaminoalanine (BOAA). The PA of BOAA is found to be 933.1 ± 7.8 kJ/mol and a prediction for the protonation entropy of -39 J mol <SUP loc=\"post\">‑1</SUP> K <SUP loc=\"post\">‑1</SUP> is also obtained, indicating a significant degree of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the protonated form. These results are supported by hybrid density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6–311++G**//B3LYP/6–31+G* level. They indicate that the preferred site of protonation is the α-nitrogen atom (PA = 935.0 kJ/mol) and that protonated BOAA has a strong hydrogen bond between the hydrogen on the α-amino group and one of the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the side chain.",

The technique uses retrieval sensitivity calculations derived from the reflectance look-up tables, coupled with estimates for the effect of various error terms on the uncertainty in inferring the reflectance at cloud-top. The error terms include the effects of the measurements, surface spectral albedos, and atmospheric corrections on both water and ice cloud retrievals. Results will deal exclusively with pixel-level uncertainties associated with plane-parallel clouds; real-world radiative departures from a plane-parallel model are an additional consideration. While we demonstrate the uncertainty technique with operational 1 km MODIS retrievals from the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua satellite platforms, the technique is generally applicable to any reflectance-based satellite- or air-borne sensor retrieval using similar spectral channels.",

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a thin (from ~0.5 to ~3 nm) fluorocarbon layer on the DLC surface. Proposed mechanisms for the formation of this layer include two competing processes: etching of DLC and deposition of fluorocarbon material, with one or the other mechanism dominant, depending on the plasma conditions. Fluorocarbon plasma-treated DLC molds for nanoimprint lithography were used to pattern sub-20 nm size features with a high degree of repeatability, demonstrating an extended lifetime of the anti-adhesion coating.",

In this study, we make use of a combination of ground-based remotely sensed and meteorological measurements at Dumont d'Urville (DDU) station, satellite images, and simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to analyze a major katabatic wind event in Adélie Land. Once well developed over the slope of the ice sheet, the katabatic flow experiences an abrupt transition near the coastal edge consisting of a sharp increase in the boundary layer depth, a sudden decrease in wind speed, and a decrease in Froude number from 3.5 to 0.3. This so-called katabatic jump manifests as a turbulent \"wall\" of blowing snow in which updrafts exceed 5 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The wall reaches heights of 1000 m and its horizontal extent along the coast is more than 400 km. By destabilizing the boundary layer downstream, the jump favors the trapping of a gravity wave train—with a horizontal wavelength of 10.5 km—that develops in a few hours. The trapped gravity waves exert a drag that considerably slows down the low-level outflow. Moreover, atmospheric rotors form below the first wave crests. The wind speed record measured at DDU in 2017 (58.5 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is due to the vertical advection of momentum by a rotor. A statistical analysis of observations at DDU reveals that katabatic jumps and low-level trapped gravity waves occur frequently over coastal Adélie Land. It emphasizes the important role of such phenomena in the coastal Antarctic dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Turbulence structures in the katabatic flow in the stable boundary layer (SBL) over the ice sheet are studied for two case studies with high wind speeds during the aircraft-based experiment KABEG (Katabatic wind and boundary layer front experiment around Greenland) in the area of southern Greenland. The aircraft data allow the direct determination of turbulence structures in the katabatic flow. For the first time, this allows the study of the turbulence structure in the katabatic wind system over the whole boundary layer and over a horizontal scale of 80 km. The katabatic flow is associated with a low-level jet (LLJ), with maximum wind speeds up to 25 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the magnitude of the turbulent fluxes show a strong decrease below the LLJ. Sensible heat fluxes at the lowest level have values down to -25 W m<SUP>-2</SUP>. Latent heat fluxes are small in general, but evaporation values of up to +13 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> are also measured. Turbulence spectra show a well-defined inertial subrange and a clear spectral gap around 250-m wavelength. While turbulence intensity decreases monotonously with height above the LLJ for the upper part of the slope, high spectral intensities are also present at upper levels close to the ice edge. Normalized fluxes and variances generally follow power-law profiles in the SBL. Terms of the TKE budget are computed from the aircraft data. The TKE destruction by the negative buoyancy is found to be very small, and the dissipation rate exceeds the dynamical production.",

During summer when the lake is thermally stratified, inflowing water and fine sediment enter the lake as overflows and shallow interflows that are transformed into complex, but mostly downlake, epilimnial currents generated by downlake katabatic winds. Coriolis deflections produce a strong right-hand tendency in sedimentation patterns, with resulting crosslake (south-to-north) as well as downlake (west-to-east) proximaldistal trends: reduction in grain size, sedimentation rates, total carbonate, dolomite/(dolomite + calcite) and varve thickness.Laminae in bottom sediments are produced by inflow variations that are largely dependent upon air temperature. Five orders of inflow, and thus sediment input, variation capable of producing laminae are recognized: diurnal, subseasonal (short-term weather changes), seasonal (nival melt vs. glacial melt), annual and exceptional inflow events. Based upon laminae character, four facies of glacier-derived and one of non-glacier-derived bottom sediments are recognized in Hector Lake.",

It has been suggested that the LIA might be the most recent of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events, which are better known as abrupt, large scale climate oscillations during the last glacial period. If the case, then according to Broecker (2000a, 2000b) Antarctica should have warmed during the LIA, when the Northern Hemisphere was cold. Here we present new data from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, that indicates surface temperatures were ~ 2 °C colder during the LIA, with colder sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean and/or increased sea-ice extent, stronger katabatic winds, and decreased snow accumulation. Whilst we find there was large spatial and temporal variability, overall Antarctica was cooler and stormier during the LIA. Although temperatures have warmed since the termination of the LIA, atmospheric circulation strength has remained at the same, elevated level. We conclude, that the LIA was either caused by alternative forcings, or that the sea-saw mechanism operates differently during warm periods.",

To better represent processes affecting ice sheet surface mass balance, such as meltwater refreezing and penetration, an additional snow/ice surface module has been developed and implemented into the surface part of the climate model. The temporal evolution and climatology of the model is evaluated with in situ coastal and ice sheet atmospheric measurements of near-surface variables and surface energy balance components. The bias for the near-surface air temperature (-0.8 °C), specific humidity (0.1 g kg<SUP>-1</SUP>), wind speed (0.3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) as well as for radiative (2.5 W m<SUP>-2</SUP> for net radiation) and turbulent heat fluxes shows that the model is in good accordance with available observations on and around the ice sheet. The modelled surface energy budget underestimates the downward longwave radiation and overestimates the sensible heat flux. Due to their compensating effect, the averaged 2 m temperature bias is small and the katabatic wind circulation well captured by the model.",

      "abstract": "Measurement of black carbon (BC) was carried out at Syowa station Antarctica (69° S, 39° E) from February 2004 until January 2007. The BC concentration at Syowa ranged from below detection to 176 ng m<SUP>-3</SUP> during the measurements. Higher BC concentrations were observed mostly under strong wind (blizzard) conditions due to the approach of a cyclone and blocking event. The BC-rich air masses traveled from the lower troposphere of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to Syowa (Antarctic coast). During the summer (November-February), the BC concentration showed a diurnal variation together with surface wind speed and increased in the katabatic wind from the Antarctic continent. Considering the low BC source strength in the Antarctic continent, the higher BC concentration in the continental air (katabatic wind) might be caused by long range transport of BC via the free troposphere from mid- and low- latitudes. The seasonal variation of BC at Syowa had a maximum in August, while at the other coastal stations (Halley, Neumayer, and Ferraz) and the continental station (Amundsen-Scott), the maximum occurred in October. This difference may result from different transport pathways and scavenging of BC by precipitation during the transport from the source regions. During the austral summer, long-range transport of BC via the free troposphere is likely to make an important contribution to the ambient BC concentration. The BC transport flux indicated that BC injection into the Antarctic region strongly depended on the frequency of storm (blizzard) conditions. The seasonal variation of BC transport flux increased by 290 mg m<SUP>-2</SUP> month<SUP>-1</SUP> in winter-spring when blizzards frequently occurred, whereas the flux decreased to lower than 50 mg m<SUP>-2</SUP> month<SUP>-1</SUP> in the summer with infrequent blizzards.",

This study provides observational validation of the aforementioned framework, using high-resolution reflectance observations from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) over 48 marine boundary layer cloud scenes. ASTER reflectances at a horizontal resolution of 30 m are aggregated up to a scale of 1,920 m, providing retrievals of τ and r<SUB>eff</SUB> at different spatial resolutions. A comparison between the PPHB derived from these retrievals and the predicted PPHB from the mathematical framework reveals a good agreement with correlation coefficients of r &gt; 0.97 (for Δτ) and r &gt; 0.79 (for Δr<SUB>eff</SUB>). To test the feasibility of PPHB predictions for present and future satellite missions, a scale analysis with varying horizontal resolutions of the subpixel and pixel-level observations is performed, followed by tests of corrections with only limited observational high-resolution data. It is shown that for reasonably thick clouds with a mean subpixel τ larger than 5, correlations between observed and predicted PPHB remain high, even if the number of available subpixels decreases or just a single band provides the information about subpixel reflectance variability. Only for thin clouds the predicted Δr<SUB>eff</SUB> become less reliable, which can be attributed primarily to an increased retrieval uncertainty for r<SUB>eff</SUB>. <P /></A>",

      "abstract": "Accurate proximity correction has proven essential for the patterning of submicron features using electron beam lithography. The use of a two-Gaussian model, which accounts for the finite beam size and forward scattering in the resist as well as backscattering, has demonstrated widespread success. It has been shown, however, that in certain instances, such as for features of order 100 nm or less or for exposure on high atomic number substrates, the two-Gaussian expression is unable to adequately fit the absorbed energy distribution in the resist. Suggested modifications, such as the addition of a third Gaussian term to account for large angle electron scattering, or the inclusion of an exponential term which may account for an increased absorption rate in high Z materials, have resulted in improved fits. This paper describes a study to determine the improvement gained in exposed features by including additional Gaussian terms in the expression for the absorbed energy distribution in the resist. A very high resolution probe (beam diameter ∼20 nm FWHM) is used so that forward scattering effects in the resist may be separated from the primary beam distribution. PMMA is exposed on Si and GaAs substrates at 25 keV using proximity correction parameters generated by curvefitting the three-Gaussian model and the two-Gaussian model to the absorbed energy distributions. The three-Gaussian model is seen to provide improved proximity correction particularly in the 100 nm size scale.",

      "abstract": "The Po Valley (Italy) model inter-comparison exercise (POMI) has been carried out in order to explore the changes in air quality in response to changes in emissions. The starting point was the evaluation of the simulated particulate matter and ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) modelled concentrations against observations for the year 2005 of the six participating chemical transport models. As models were run with the same configuration in terms of spatial resolution, boundary condition, emissions and meteorology, the differences presented in the models' results are only related to their formulation. As described in the paper, significant efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of the anthropogenic emissions and meteorological input data. Nevertheless, none of the models using the proposed meteorology succeeded to fulfil the quality performance criteria set in the 2008 Air Quality Directive and in the literature for particulate matter, while also for ozone the results are not very satisfying. Although the overall performances look better for O<SUB>3</SUB> than for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm (PM10), the models tend to exhibit a similar behaviour and show the largest model variability in locations where concentrations are the highest (urban areas for PM10 and suburbs and hilly areas for O<SUB>3</SUB>). While differences are significant in terms of standard deviation and bias, the correlation remains quite similar among models indicating that models generally capture well the main temporal variations, especially the seasonal ones. Possible explanations for this common behaviour and a discussion of the differences among models' results are presented in this paper.",

The Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer measured up- and downward irradiance on the high-altitude (ER-2) and the low-altitude (DC-8) aircraft, which allowed deriving apparent absorption on a point-by-point basis along the flight track. Apparent absorption is the vertical divergence of irradiance, calculated from the difference of net flux at the top and bottom of a cloud. While this is the only practical method of deriving absorption from aircraft radiation measurements, it differs from true absorption when horizontal flux divergence is nonzero. Differences between true and apparent absorption are inevitable in any inhomogeneous atmosphere, especially clouds. We show, for the first time, the spectral shape of measured apparent absorption and compare with results from a three-dimensional radiative transfer model. The model cloud field is created from optical thickness and effective radius retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator and from reflectivity profiles from the Cloud Radar System, both on board the ER-2. Although the spectral shape is reproduced by the model calculations, the measured apparent absorption in the visible spectral range is higher than the model results along extended parts of the flight leg. This is possibly due to a net loss of photons into neighboring cirrus-free areas that are not contained within the model domain.",

A comparison is made with the description by Maxwell Garnett. A general method for the calculation of the polarizability of these particles is discussed.

Semiconductor-based artificial graphene (AG) is an ideal system for these studies that combines high-mobility electron gases with AG topology. However, to date, low-disorder conditions that reveal the interplay of electron-electron interaction with AG symmetry have not been achieved. Here, we report the creation of low-disorder AG that preserves the near-perfection of the pristine electron layer by fabricating small period triangular antidot lattices on high-quality quantum wells. Resonant inelastic light scattering spectra show collective spin-exciton modes at the M-point's nearly flatband saddle-point singularity in the density of states. The observed Coulomb exchange interaction energies are comparable to the gap of Dirac bands at the M-point, demonstrating interplay between quasiparticle interactions and the AG potential. The saddle-point exciton energies are in the terahertz range, making low-disorder AG suitable for contemporary optoelectronic applications.",

Recently, Arctic fjords have been recognized as the critical gateway through which oceanic waters can impact on the stability of glaciers. Arctic fjords are also used as idealized locations to study ice-influenced physical, biological and geochemical processes. In all cases a clear understanding of the physical oceanographic environment is required to interpret and predict related impacts and linkages. In this review we consider the characteristic elements of Arctic fjords and the important dynamical processes. We show how the intense seasonality of these regions is reflected in the varying stratification of the fjords. In particular, we show that sea ice has a central role in terms of the fjord salinity which ultimately influences the exchange with oceanic waters. When the fjord is ice free, wind forcing from the intense down-fjord katabatic winds gives rise to rapidly changing cross-fjord gradients, upwelling and strong surface circulations. The stratification and dimensions of Arctic fjords mean that they are often classed as broad fjords where rotational effects are important in their circulation. We refer to the link between the physical oceanographic conditions and the related depositional records throughout.",

      "abstract": "The FLOHOF field campaign took place in the period July 21 to August 24, 2007 on and in the surroundings of Hofsjökull glacier in Central Iceland. During the campaign, 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) recording temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, pressure, and precipitation were deployed on and around the glacier. In addition, atmospheric soundings were performed N and S of Hofsjökull by a tethered balloon, pilot balloons, and two unmanned aerial systems (UAS). An energy balance station, consisting of a net radiometer and an eddy correlation flux measurement station, has also been installed. This paper describes the experimental setup of the campaign and presents first results of the data analysis with respect to transience of mountain-induced gravity waves, the extension of katabatic winds into the surrounding of the glacier, the occurrence of katabatic microfronts, and report on novel approaches to probe the vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer by UAS. The observed pressure perturbations related to transient gravity wave activity due to changing inflow conditions were between ‑2 and 2 hPa in general, with positive values upstream and negative values downstream. Differential heating of the glacier and its surrounding is triggering daytime katabatic flow from the glacier into its surrounding. During the campaign, those katabatic winds typically reached out 4–7 km from the edge of the glacier. During late night in clear sky conditions, frontal-like microstructures have been observed frequently with typical repetition times in the order of 30–60 min indicating the interaction of large-scale synoptic and nighttime katabatic density flows close to the ground. The first research application of the newly developed small unmanned meteorological observer proved the applicability of the system for atmospheric boundary layer research by successfully profiling the atmosphere up to 3.5 km above ground.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the process of water-column stratification breakdown in Antarctic coastal polynyas adjacent to an ice shelf with a cavity underneath. This first part of a two-part sequence seeks to quantify the influence of offshore katabatic winds, alongshore winds, air temperature, and initial ambient stratification on the time scales of polynya destratification through combining process-oriented numerical simulations and analytical scaling. In particular, the often-neglected influence of wind-driven circulation on the lateral transport of the water formed at the polynya surface—which we call Polynya Source Water (PSW)—is systematically examined here. First, an ice shelf-sea ice-ocean coupled numerical model is adapted to simulate the process of PSW formation in polynyas of various configurations. The simulations highlight that (i) before reaching the bottom, majority of the PSW is actually carried away from the polynya by katabatic wind-induced offshore outflow, diminishing water-column mixing in the polynya and intrusion of the PSW into the neighboring ice shelf cavity, and (ii) alongshore coastal easterly winds, through inducing onshore Ekman transport, reduce offshore loss of the PSW and enhance polynya mixing and PSW intrusion into the cavity. Second, an analytical scaling of the destratification time scale is derived based on fundamental physical principles to quantitatively synthesize the influence of the physical factors, which is then verified by independent numerical sensitivity simulations. This work provides insights into the mechanisms that drive temporal and cross-polynya variations in stratification and PSW formation in Antarctic coastal polynyas, and establishes a framework for studying differences among the polynyas in the ocean.",

      "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced dramatic mass loss in the past 30 years and become a major source of global sea-level rise. At least half of its total mass loss can be attributed to surface melt which is controlled by the surface energy budget. To identify the critical processes responsible for this surface melt, we examine 12-year of hourly surface melt and energy flux observations from 23 automatic weather stations in the ablation zone of Greenland. Local melt increases from North to South and from East to West. The smallest annual ice melt occurs at the northernmost station (KPC_U: 0.23 m w.e.); largest at the southernmost station (QAS_L: 5.27 m w.e.). The seasonal variability of surface melt is primarily determined by net shortwave radiation, a product of insolation and albedo. Correlation between melt and albedo is above 0.7 at all the stations. After removing the seasonal cycle, we define and attribute \"local\" melt events to the remaining variabilities. To estimate contributions of each energy budget component to melt events, we use 7-day moving correlation weighted by flux magnitudes. Local melt events are mostly explained by sensible heat fluxes (30%), followed by shortwave radiation (27%), longwave radiation (14%), and latent heat (12%) (subsurface heat fluxes are not estimated). During the massive Greenland-wide surface melt in 2012, sensible heat accounted for 35% of melt events; shortwave radiation 27%, longwave radiation 11%, and latent heat 12%. At most stations, sensible heat and shortwave radiation enhance melt when winds blow from the upslope direction, indicating that dry katabatic wind mixing is most responsible for local melt events. Low humidity during katabatic winds is associated with increased shortwave downwelling radiation. The high speed of katabatic winds enhances vertical mixing that reduces the temperature inversion and increases sensible heat flux towards the surface. Although moisture intrusions and thus longwave radiation have been reported to be responsible for large melt extents during a handful of massive melt episodes, sensible heat and shortwave radiation, enhanced by katabatic winds, contribute more to local melt events and the total mass loss.",

Field observations (GPS, GPR, and surface measurements) have provided a detailed description of megadune sedimentation and morphology over a 70 km<SUP>2</SUP> area, located 200 km east of Dome C. A combination of remote sensing analysis (using Landsat and satellite radar altimetry) and field measurements indicate that slope in the prevailing wind direction (SPWD) and climatic conditions play a crucial role in megadune genesis. The megadune areas tend to be characterized by slightly steeper regional slope and the presence of highly persistent katabatic winds. The megadunes represent 2 to 4 m amplitude waves of 2 to 5 km wavelength formed by variable net accumulation, ranging between 25% (leeward faces) to 120% (windward faces) of the accumulation in adjacent nonmegadune areas. Leeward faces are characterized by glazed, sastrugi-free surfaces and extensive depth hoar formation. Windward faces are covered by large rough sastrugi up to 1.5 m in height.",

Cyclic steps are quasi-stable, repeating, and upstream-migrating bed forms that have been studied in terrestrial and submarine environments. The repeating pattern is bounded by hydraulic jumps, which act to stabilize the form. We use radar stratigraphy from the Shallow Radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to examine trough evolution and constrain lateral transport. We examine visible images from the Thermal Emission Imaging System and observe low-altitude clouds that we interpret to be the result of katabatic jumps, i.e., the Aeolian counterpart of hydraulic jumps in open channel flow. We then devise a theoretical framework for understanding the origin of the spiral troughs that agree with 10 criteria that should be explained for any scenario to satisfactorily model the spiral troughs. Finally, we use Froude and geometrical analysis to estimate the rate of upstream migration caused by katabatic winds for the spiral troughs.",

      "abstract": "Wavelet analyses of the surface winds at Dumont d'Urville, an East Antarctic station, have been performed for the months April, June, September, and December 1993, representing autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively. The 3 hourly 10 min averaged meteorological station data have been used. The site is characterized by intense katabatic winds that arrive from the southeast. During the year 1993 the maximum occurrence of wind was from 160° direction sector. The wavelet transform spectra of horizontal wind show prominent periodicities in the interval between 2 and 20 days. The spectral energies in the diurnal scale are comparatively very low even in summer. A comparison with wavelet spectra of pressure for synoptic scale (2-10 days) confirms the influence of synoptic disturbances that are frequent in coastal regions of the Antarctic continent. The same analysis carried out on the wind components, parallel and transverse to the main katabatic flow direction, reveals that these periodicities are mainly due to the katabatic flow behavior. Although the katabatic wind flow is the dominant force characterizing the day-to-day weather conditions, the influence of transient cyclones offshore cannot be ignored; in situations of considerable synoptic activity the intensity and duration of katabatic wind flow are prolonged.",

The first one, the Dressed Cluster Method, provides excellent evaluations of the cohesive energy. The discontinuity of its derivative around the critical (isotropic) value of the anisotropy parameter confirms the first-order character of the phase transition. Nevertheless, the method introduces two distinct reference functions (either Néel or XY ) which may, in principle, force the discontinuity. The Real-Space Renormalization Group with Effective Interactions does not reach the same numerical accuracy, but it does not introduce a reference function and the phase transition appears qualitatively, due to the existence of two domains with specific fixed points. The method confirms the dependence of the spin gap on the anisotropy parameter occurring in the Heisenberg-Ising domain.",

Sequential MSn experiments with the ion trap instrument allowed the characterization of the substituting side chain. Mono- and diphosphorylated singly or doubly deprotonated lipid A molecules have been studied and provided complementary information.

To determine the contribution of AE-derived AOH to the total concentration of AE and AOH in WWTP effluents, we conducted a laboratory continuous activated-sludge study (CAS). This consisted of a test unit fed with AE-amended synthetic sewage and a control unit fed with only synthetic sewage to avoid AE contamination from the feed. The removal efficiencies of some 114 AE homologues were determined by the application of a specific and sensitive analytical method. The extent of the removal of AE ranged from 99.70% for C <SUB>18</SUB> compounds to &gt;99.98% for C <SUB>12-16</SUB>. Relatively high-AOH concentrations were observed in the effluents from blank and test units. By building the concentration difference from the test minus the control unit, the AE in the CAS effluent originating from AE in the influent was determined. Thus, it could be shown that AOH represented only 19% of the total AE (EO <SUB>0-18</SUB>) in the CAS, while monitoring in 29 WWTP effluents (European, Canadian, and US) revealed in total a mean AOH fraction of 55% (5-82%) of the total AE (EO <SUB>0-18</SUB>). This shows that only a small fraction of AOH in WWTP effluents originates from AE entering the WWTP.",

The intermolecular potential is decomposed into a sum of distortion energies for the subsystems and the interaction energy between the distorted subsystems. The latter term is decomposed into a Coulombic, exchange and correlation part. The Coulombic component is further partitioned into an electrostatic and induction component. By considering seven different structures of the complex it is found that the ordering of the values of the electrostatic energy component coincides with the ordering of the values of the intermolecular potential. In particular both the electrostatic energy component and the intermolecular potential predict that the global minimum of the potential has a T structure.",

During moderate prevailing large-scale flow, nocturnal jets were simulated that were rather similar to those on Earth. They were mainly caused by inertial oscillation after sunset with some contribution from the slope wind effects over sloping regions (which are very common in Mars). During weak large-scale flow, shallow nocturnal drainage flows with strong vertical shear developed over the cold Martian slopes. At middle and high latitudes, these katabatic winds tended to turn to flow along the slope by dawn (due to the Coriolis force). For sufficiently steep slopes, near-surface drainage winds could reach considerable speeds. In contrast, the typical afternoon upslope winds were vertically homogeneous up to 2-3 km and weak (only 1-3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> in magnitude), even over relatively steep large-scale slopes.",

The anomaly in the diurnal variations of AEC and the PG is displaying an ostensible minimum at 10 UT and a diminished response to the thunderstorm over the African continent in the 14-16 UT time frame. The data sets (2005-2014, except 2012) of the PG, and to some extent, AEC, from Maitri, are used to explore this anomaly. It follows that the fair-weather electrical phenomena over Maitri can be ascribed to global electrified convection on the one hand and to regional phenomena like convection due to the replacement of warm air by katabatic winds on the other hand. The katabatic winds originate on the polar plateau and blow from 130° at Maitri which are likely to transport various elements from the mountain slopes, and space charge from the polar plateau is expected to produce various disturbances in the PG and AEC monitored over the coastal Antarctica. This mechanism may be responsible for peaks in the early UT hours and also for the anomalous behavior of atmospheric electrical parameters observed at Maitri. Maitri data are compared with that of Carnegie cruise and Vostok to explain the source of anomaly.",

Of interest was the nocturnal boundary layer on a slope (in particular, katabatic flows) in the absence of significant synoptic influence. Extensive measurements of mean flow, turbulence, temperature, and solar radiation were made, from which circulation patterns on the slope and the nature of stratified turbulence in katabatic winds were inferred. The results show that near the surface (&lt;25-50 m) the nocturnal flow is highly stratified and directed downslope, but at higher levels winds strongly vary in magnitude and direction with height and time, implying the domination of upper levels by air intrusions. These intrusions may peel off from different slopes surrounding the SLB, have different densities, and flow at their equilibrium density levels. The turbulence was generally weak and continuous, but sudden increases of turbulence levels were detected as the mean gradient Richardson number (<SUB></SUB>) dropped to about unity. With a short timescale <SUB></SUB> fluctuated on the order of a few tens of seconds while modulating with a longer (along-slope internal waves sloshing) timescale of about half an hour. The mixing efficiency (or the flux Richardson number) of the flow was found to be a strong function of <SUB></SUB>, similar to that found in laboratory experiments with inhomogeneous stratified shear flows. The eddy diffusivities of momentum and heat were evaluated, and they showed a systematic variation with <SUB></SUB> when scaled with the shear length scale and the rms vertical velocity of turbulence.",

The origin of these concentrations of extraterrestrial debris appears to be similar to that of Antarctic meteorites; micrometeorites ablating out of blue ice are transported downwind and downslope by strong katabatic winds to the nearest aeolian sediment trap. In the Walcott Névé, these traps are the crests of moraines, weathering debris around boulders, and rough, exposed areas of snow.

It is based on the operational MODIS algorithm. This paper documents the technical details of this algorithm and evaluates the retrievals for selected marine boundary layer cloud scenes through comparisons with the operational MODIS Data Collection 6 (C6) cloud product. The newly developed, ASTER-specific cloud masking algorithm is evaluated through comparison with an independent algorithm reported in [Zhao and Di Girolamo(2006)]. To validate and evaluate the cloud optical thickness (τ) and cloud effective radius (r<SUB>eff</SUB>) from ASTER, the high-spatial-resolution ASTER observations are first aggregated to the same 1000 m resolution as MODIS. Subsequently, τ<SUB>aA</SUB> and r<SUB>eff, &lt;mspace linebreak=\"nobreak\" width=\"0.25em\"/&gt;aA</SUB> retrieved from the aggregated ASTER radiances are compared with the collocated MODIS retrievals. For overcast pixels, the two data sets agree very well with Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients of R &gt; 0.970. However, for partially cloudy pixels there are significant differences between r<SUB>eff, &lt;mspace linebreak=\"nobreak\" width=\"0.25em\"/&gt;aA</SUB> and the MODIS results which can exceed 10 µm. Moreover, it is shown that the numerous delicate cloud structures in the example marine boundary layer scenes, resolved by the high-resolution ASTER retrievals, are smoothed by the MODIS observations. The overall good agreement between the research-level ASTER results and the operational MODIS C6 products proves the feasibility of MODIS-like retrievals from ASTER reflectance measurements and provides the basis for future studies concerning the scale dependency of satellite observations and three-dimensional radiative effects.",

      "abstract": "Polymetallic ore deposits of the Aegean Sea, Greece, are temporally and spatially associated with the emplacement of Miocene granitoids and Pliocene to Quaternary volcanic units along the active volcanic arc and occur adjacent to the crustal-scale detachment systems. A variety of mineral deposits (e.g., carbonate-replacement, skarn, porphyry, vein-type, and low- to high-sulfidation epithermal deposits) formed during different stages of back-arc evolution and can be found in the footwall and hanging wall of the major detachment systems and all tectono-stratigraphic units. New galena Pb-isotope data collected by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis exhibit a range of isotopic ratios: <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>204</SUP>Pb: 18.68-18.91, <SUP>207</SUP>Pb/<SUP>204</SUP>Pb: 15.67-15.75 and <SUP>208</SUP>Pb/<SUP>204</SUP>Pb: 38.83-39.18, with a resolvable geographic pattern. Together with compiled Pb-isotope data of Cycladic galena, large-scale regional similarities in the Pb-isotope signatures are recognized, suggesting distinct sources of lead in the underlying basement. Base metal-rich deposits in the west Cyclades have a common lead source with a more radiogenic signature, whereas lead in the deposits in the north-central Cyclades was derived from a less radiogenic source. Similarities between the Pb-isotopic signature of galena and regional host rocks suggest, that the pre-Alpine Cycladic Basement was the main source of lead for the deposits in the north and central, and the metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary Lower Cycladic Blueschist Nappe was the source of lead for the deposits in the west. Moreover, there is a close spatial relationship of the <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>204</SUP>Pb 18.84 line and trace of the proposed Trans-Cycladic Thrust. Regional trends were also observed in the new LA-ICP-MS trace element analysis in galena. Galena in carbonate-replacement and skarn deposits in the west is enriched in base metals and silver, whereas galena in vein-type deposits in the north and low- to high-sulfidation epithermal deposits along the active volcanic arc is enriched in gold, tellurides and selenium. Combined trace element and isotopic data of galena indicate distinct metal sources in the Cyclades. Heterogenous rock assemblages of mixed provenance and age account for the differences in lead isotopes. Whereas the base metals and silver are ultimately sourced from the basement, the precious metals might be derived from the metasomatized lithospheric mantle.",

The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model and the GAINS integrated assessment model, which makes use of source receptor information precalculated by the EMEP MSC-W model, use resolutions of 0.1<mml:math altimg=\"si1.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1715\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>°</mml:mo><mml:mspace class=\"nbsp\" width=\"1em\"></mml:mspace><mml:mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" linebreakstyle=\"after\">×</mml:mo><mml:mspace class=\"nbsp\" width=\"1em\"></mml:mspace><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>°</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math> and 0.3<mml:math altimg=\"si2.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1733\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>°</mml:mo><mml:mspace class=\"nbsp\" width=\"1em\"></mml:mspace><mml:mo linebreak=\"goodbreak\" linebreakstyle=\"after\">×</mml:mo><mml:mspace class=\"nbsp\" width=\"1em\"></mml:mspace><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>°</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math>. These resolutions cannot account for variability at finer scales. Variability within grids, both concentration and population distributions, can be significant. To improve exposure calculations that take into account the sub-grid variability, the uEMEP model has been applied in this study to provide suitable parameterisations of the sub-grid variability within an EMEP MSC-W grid. The uEMEP model is applied on a European domain at 250 × 250 m<mml:math altimg=\"si3.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1751\"><mml:msup><mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math>.

The analysis derives an exposure correction factor (ECF) for each source sector in each EMEP MSC-W grid. This factor provides information on the impact of sub-grid resolution on the population weighted concentrations within each grid. The population weighted standard deviation is also calculated, providing information on sub-grid variability to derive frequency distributions and parameterised forms of the sub-grid variability suitable for health risk assessments. The impact of sub-grid variability is assessed for the pollutants PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, NO<mml:math altimg=\"si157.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1781\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> and NO<mml:math altimg=\"si206.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1789\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math>.

We show that the parameterised form of the sub-grid variability provides close to equivalent results as the original uEMEP calculations. Exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> increases by around 13% when the sub-grid variability is taken into account for a 2030 emission scenario.

A similar increase is found in the health risk indicator 'population attributable fraction' when no lower concentration threshold is used in the concentration–response function. When applying the World Health Organizations recommended threshold value we find that including the sub-grid variability increases the calculated population attributable fraction by 32% and 46% for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> and NO<mml:math altimg=\"si206.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e1829\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> respectively.

In a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of seven BEBs, we consider three battery technologies combined with relevant pack sizes to evaluate the size and range effect. The environmental performance of the BEBs was assessed over the typical length of a bus tender of 10 years as well as an extended lifetime of 20 years. Across six environmental impact categories we found that the size and range effect depends to a large extent on the performance of the battery technology and that a smaller battery size of the same technology is not necessarily environmentally preferable. Furthermore, extending the BEB lifetime from 10 to 20 years changes the environmental performance as well as relative contributions to environmental impact potentials for the various BEB alternatives.",

These devices have been designed to emphasize different aspects of their electrical switching behavior, so that we may learn more about their transport properties. In one structure, back-gate CNFETs were built to study the effects of vertical scaling by varying the thickness of an underlying high-quality gate dielectric. An unexpected dependence of the subthreshold slope and transconductance on the gate dielectric thickness was observed, and was attributed to Schottky barrier switching at the metal/nanotube contacts. A second structure incorporates a top gate electrode with multiple, individually addressable segments of different width. This design decouples the interior of the device from the contacts, thereby enabling the study of lateral scaling within the same physical device structure. Clear indications of bulk switching were observed in this device, with strong evidence of ballistic transport, suggesting that CNFETs do not follow conventional gate length scaling rules.",

The cDNA was inserted into the Pst I endonuclease site of plasmid pBR322 by the use of the poly(dC) and poly(dG) tailing procedure. Clones containing gastrin sequences were selected by hybridization to a purified single-stranded 32P-labeled gastrin cDNA probe. This probe was constructed with gastrinoma mRNA as template. As primer for the cDNA synthesis, we used a synthetic oligonucleotide mixture, d(AG-A-A-AG-T-C-C-A-T-C-C-A), corresponding to the gastrin-specific amino acid sequence Trp-Met-Asp-Phe. In this way we determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region (303 nucleotides), the entire 3' untranslated region (102 nucleotides), and 8 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region. A striking homology between parts of the coding region suggests that evolution of the gastrin gene has involved a gene duplication.",

      "abstract": "Despite playing a key role in modulating earths upper tropospheric radiation budget, ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) remains a source of uncertainty in global climate models, making accurate long-term measurements important for understanding climate change related cloud feedbacks. IOT for thin cirrus is an especially challenging parameter to retrieve from passive satellite instruments due to their varying spatial scales, retrieval assumptions and opaqueness. A historical lack of direct in-situ measurements motivates a validation and examination of the accuracy of passive IOT retrieved products. Recent advancements in geo-stationary capabilities with the launch of next generation imagers such as the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and the Japanese Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) provide new opportunities to leverage ground-based measurements due to the greatly increased sampling over individual sites compared to LEO. Similar to AERONET validation efforts, in this study we utilize data collected by the University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) during the NASA KORUS-AQ in Seoul South Korea, the CAMP2Ex mission based in Manila Philippines, the ONR ship-based PISTON campaign in the South West Pacific, and data collected in Madison, WI to evaluate IOT from a beta version of the NASA CLDPROP and the NOAA CLAVR-x visible, infrared and hybrid retrievals processed on AHI/ABI data. An ice cloud detection algorithm is developed for the HSRL instrument capable of accurate detection and measurements of ice properties including direct measurements of IOT. In addition, the HSRL observations are further constrained by examining the uncertainty of the IOT using the statistical bootstrapping approach. Direct comparisons of the IOT retrievals with the HSRL over multiple months of observation will be presented with a focus on investigating systematic biases in the satellite retrievals and the impact of regional ice crystal morphology. Initial results show that the CLAVR-x infrared retrieval utilizing the split window approach has better agreement with the HSRL than its visible counterpart utilizing the bi-spectral reflectance approach for optically thin cirrus (IOT &lt; 1.5) at the CAMP2EX site in Manila, Philippines (R2 = 0.74 vs R2 = 0.40) and at during the PISTON campaign (R2 = 0.80 vs R2 = 0.64).",

      "abstract": "Permafrost thaw has been observed at several locations across the pan-Arctic in recent decades, yet the pan-Arctic extent and potential spatial-temporal variations in thaw are poorly constrained. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be inferred and quantified with satellite imagery due to the subsequent differential ground subsidence and erosion that also affects land surface cover, storage and flow of water, sediment, and nutrients. However, a lack of supporting cyberinfrastructure necessary to harness information from the existing and rapidly growing collection of high-resolution satellite imagery (Big Imagery) has limited our advances in understanding the nature of pan-Arctic permafrost degradation. In the coming four years, we will empower the broader Arctic community with a cyberinfrastructure platform, the Permafrost Discovery Gateway (PDG), aimed at making Big Imagery permafrost information accessible and discoverable through novel visualization and analysis tools designed with input from users of the PDG, e.g. the diverse peoples living, working, and/or studying in the Arctic. From the start of the project, we will engage the user-community through in-person and online meetings to ensure effective development of permafrost Big Imagery products for archiving, processing, analyzing, and visualizing. The framework will utilize existing resources, such as the (1) NSF supported data management resources the Arctic Data Center and Clowder, (2) web application visualization tools (Fluid Earth Viewer, Google Earth, and Gapminder Foundation), (3) high performance computing resources (XSEDE, Google Earth Engine etc.), and (4) and satellite imagery (Polar Geospatial Center, Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet). The PDG will include the management of ingesting remote sensing big data into machine and deep learning models. We welcome collaborations with national and international Native, industry, and academic organizations and individuals to ensure broad community engagement and dissemination. The PDG will enable diverse peoples to contribute to and have access to pan-Arctic permafrost knowledge, which can immediately inform the economy, security, and resilience of the Nation, the Arctic region, and the globe with respect to pan-Arctic change.",

These are quantities that cannot be derived from measurements alone. In areas with high levels of reduced N<SUB>r</SUB> (RDN = NH<SUB>3</SUB>+ NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>), oxidized N<SUB>r</SUB> (OXN = NO<SUB>x</SUB>+ HNO<SUB>3</SUB>+ HONO + N<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> + NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>+ \"Other OXN\" species), and oxidized S<SUB>r</SUB> (OXS = SO<SUB>2</SUB>+ SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP>), RDN is predominantly in the form of NH<SUB>3</SUB> (NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> typically &lt;20 %), OXN has majority gaseous species composition, and OXS predominantly comprises SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> except near major SO<SUB>2</SUB> sources. Most continental regions are now \"ammonia rich\", more so than previously, which indicates that, although reducing NH<SUB>3</SUB> emissions will decrease the RDN concentration, decreasing these emissions will have little effect on mitigating secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA). South Asia is the most ammonia-rich region. Coastal areas around East Asia, northern Europe, and the north-eastern United States are \"nitrate rich\" where NH<SUB>4</SUB>NO<SUB>3</SUB> formation is limited by NH<SUB>3</SUB>. These locations experience transport of OXN from the adjacent continent and/or direct shipping emissions of NO<SUB>x</SUB>, but NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations are lower. The least populated continental areas and most marine areas are \"sulfate rich\". Deposition of OXN (57.9 TgN yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, 51 %) and RDN (55.5 TgN yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, 49 %) contribute almost equally to total nitrogen deposition. OXS deposition is 50.5 TgS yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Globally, wet and dry deposition contribute similarly to RDN deposition; for OXN and OXS, wet deposition contributes slightly more. Dry deposition of NH<SUB>3</SUB> is the largest contributor to RDN deposition in most regions except for the Rest of Asia area and marine sectors where NH<SUB>3</SUB> emissions are small and RDN deposition is mainly determined by the transport and rainout of NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> (rather than rainout of gaseous NH<SUB>3</SUB>). Thus, reductions in NH<SUB>3</SUB> would efficiently reduce the deposition of RDN in most continental regions. The two largest contributors to OXN deposition in all regions are HNO<SUB>3</SUB> and coarse NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> (via both wet and dry deposition). The deposition of fine NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> is only important over East Asia. The tropospheric burden of RDN is 0.75 TgN, of which NH<SUB>3</SUB> and NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> comprise 32 % (0.24 TgN; lifetime of 1.6 d) and 68 % (0.51 TgN; lifetime of 8.9 d) respectively. The lifetime of RDN (4.9-5.2 d) is shorter than that of OXN (7.6-7.7 d), which is consistent with a total OXN burden (1.20 TgN) almost double that of RDN. The tropospheric burden of OXS is 0.78 TgS with a lifetime of 5.6-5.9 d. Total nitrate burden is 0.58 TgN with fine NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> only constituting 10 % of this total, although fine NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> dominates in eastern China, Europe, and eastern North America. It is important to account for contributions of coarse nitrate to global nitrate budgets. Lifetimes of RDN, OXN, and OXS species vary by a factor of 4 across different continental regions. In East Asia, lifetimes for RDN (2.9-3.0 d), OXN (3.9-4.5 d), and OXS (3.4-3.7 d) are short, whereas lifetimes in the Rest of Asia and Africa regions are about twice as long. South Asia is the largest net exporter of RDN (2.21 TgN yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, 29 % of its annual emission), followed by the Euro_Medi region. Despite having the largest RDN emissions and deposition, East Asia has only small net export and is therefore largely responsible for its own RDN pollution. Africa is the largest net exporter of OXN (1.92 TgN yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, 22 %), followed by Euro_Medi (1.61 TgN yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, 26 %). Considerable marine anthropogenic N<SUB>r</SUB> and S<SUB>r</SUB> pollution is revealed by the large net import of RDN, OXN, and OXS to these areas. Our work demonstrates the substantial regional variation in N<SUB>r</SUB> and S<SUB>r</SUB> budgets and the need for modelling to simulate the chemical and meteorological linkages underpinning atmospheric responses to precursor emissions.",

One application of this technology is the treatment of flue gases from combustion processes for the purpose of carbon capture and storage. For this application, poly(ethylene oxide)-containing block copolymers such as Pebax<SUP>®</SUP> or PolyActive™ polymer are well suited. The thin-film composite membrane that is considered in this overview employs PolyActive™ polymer as a selective layer material.

The membrane can be manufactured reproducibly on a pilot scale and mounted into flat-sheet membrane modules of different designs. The operating performance of these modules can be accurately predicted by specifically developed simulation tools, which employ single-gas permeation data as the only experimental input. The performance of membranes and modules was investigated in different pilot plant studies, in which flue gas and biogas were used as the feed gas streams. The investigated processes showed a stable separation performance, indicating the applicability of PolyActive™ polymer as a membrane material for industrial-scale gas processing.",

Measurements at energies from vacuum UV at a high-harmonic generation (HHG)-based source to the soft and hard X-ray range at a synchrotron facility validated the results of theoretical ray-tracing calculations. The key element is a ring electrode concentric with the extractor electrode, which can tailor the field in the gap. First, the gap-lens-assisted extractor mode reduces the field strength at the sample while mitigating image aberrations. This mode gave good results in all spectral ranges. Secondly, by compensating the field at the sample surface with a negative voltage at the ring electrode we can operate in zero-field mode, which is beneficial for operando experiments. Finally, higher negative voltages establish the repeller mode, which removes all slow electrons below a certain kinetic energy to eliminate the primary contribution to the space-charge interaction in pump-probe experiments. The switch from extractor to repeller mode is associated with a reduction in the k-field-of-view (10-20 % at hard-X-ray energies, increasing to ~50% at low energies). Real-space imaging also benefits from the new lens modes as confirmed by ToF-XPEEM imaging with 650 nm resolution.",

In this work we provide sharp results for the implicit regularization imposed by the gradient flow of Diagonal Linear Networks (DLNs) in the over-parameterized regression setting and, potentially surprisingly, link this to the phenomenon of phase transitions in generalized hardness of approximation (GHA). GHA generalizes the phenomenon of hardness of approximation from computer science to, among others, continuous and robust optimization. It is well-known that the $\\ell^1$-norm of the gradient flow of DLNs with tiny initialization converges to the objective function of basis pursuit. We improve upon these results by showing that the gradient flow of DLNs with tiny initialization approximates minimizers of the basis pursuit optimization problem (as opposed to just the objective function), and we obtain new and sharp convergence bounds w.r.t.\\ the initialization size. Non-sharpness of our results would imply that the GHA phenomenon would not occur for the basis pursuit optimization problem -- which is a contradiction -- thus implying sharpness. Moreover, we characterize $\\textit{which}$ $\\ell_1$ minimizer of the basis pursuit problem is chosen by the gradient flow whenever the minimizer is not unique. Interestingly, this depends on the depth of the DLN.",

The result shows that a large amount of cold air, significant at even a global climatological scale, is exported through this process from high- to low-latitude regions. The theory gives also the average intensity of the wind at the coast. In the coastal regions of Antarctica the wind exhibits a complex behavior. Observations show that katabatic winds in the near-coastal region can be periodic or continuous, or can stay a long time in a quiescent near-critical state, then burst in short and strong gusts. We examine some aspects of these katabatic winds in terms of the mesoscale energy theory developed by Dalu and Green (1983). This complex behavior is described by a nonlinear system, where the relevant parameter is the Froude number of the inflow at a Rossby radius distance from the coast. The analytical theory developed agrees well with qualitative features observed.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of a cliff-top dune system located at the foot of the Mackenzie Mountains was reconstructed by radiocarbon dating and tree ring analysis of forest paleosols in eolian sediments. The first evidence of eolian activity dates to ca. 3000 yr B.P. when the breaching of a bedrock sill initiated the erosion of glaciofluvial deposits that resulted in the exposure of a 75-m-high cliff of erodible sediment. Sandy sediment eroded from the cliff By katabatic winds from the Mackenzie Mountains buried a mature forest growing on alluvial sediments. Despite a minor eolian event between 750 and 860 cal yr A.D., dune development began ca. 1100 cal yr A.D. and has been marked by two major sedimentation periods between ca. 1100 cal yr A.D. and 1460 A.D. and from 1865 to present. Detailed analysis of tree morbidity and mortality indicates that the dune progressed at an average rate of 78 cm/yr for the last century. Dune dynamics are directly related to slope activity that controls the episodic nature of sediment availability and to the katabatic wind regime. Comparison of the dune dynamics and paleoclimatic data suggest a possible influence of warm climate on eolian activity.",

      "abstract": "Understanding gravity currents developing on complex topography, which involve turbulence and mixing processes on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, is of importance for estimating near ground fluxes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation. We present experimental results, based on high resolution velocity and density measurements, of constant upstream buoyancy supply gravity currents flowing from a horizontal boundary onto a tangent hyperbolic shaped slope. The mean flow, turbulence characteristics, and mixing properties, the latter expressed in terms of mixing lengths and eddy coefficients, are determined, highlighting their dependency on topography. These mean flow and mixing characteristics are compared with the field measurements in katabatic winds by Charrondière et al. [\"Mean flow structure of katabatic winds and turbulent mixing properties,\" J. Fluid Mech. 941, A11 (2022)], which are gravity flows that develop over sloping terrain due to radiative cooling at the surface. The results obtained show that the mean katabatic flow structure is substantially different from that of the upstream buoyancy supply gravity current. However interestingly, dimensionless mixing lengths and eddy coefficients compare well despite the difference in the mean flow structure and a two order of magnitude difference in the Reynolds number.",

The simulations shown here are two dimensional and cover the July 5-24, 1991, period, a typical fine weather period in that area. The synoptic scale wind, temperature, and humidity evolution are included. Simulated wind and temperature compare reasonably well with available observations. The simulated snow/ice melting is examined, and the sensitivity of the model to the ice-sheet surface representation is discussed by replacing the snow/ice model by a classical force-restore model. It is found that the melting-refreezing of liquid water in the snow pack impacts significantly the surface energy and mass balances of the ice sheet. In particular, the nighttime surface temperature minimum and katabatic wind speed are less marked when the refreezing process is activated in the model.",

Recently we discovered that by intercalating Ag<SUP>+</SUP> in polycytosine-mismatch oligonucleotides, the resulting C-Ag<SUP>+</SUP>-C duplexes are able to conduct charge efficiently. To map the functionality and biostability of this system, we built and characterized internally-functionalized DNA nanowires through non-canonical, Ag<SUP>+</SUP>-mediated base pairing in duplexes containing cytosine-cytosine mismatches. We assessed the thermal and chemical stability of ion-coordinated duplexes in aqueous solutions and conclude that the C-Ag<SUP>+</SUP>-C bond forms DNA duplexes with replicable geometry, predictable thermodynamics, and tunable length. We demonstrated continuous ion chain formation in oligonucleotides of 11-50 nucleotides (nt), and enzyme ligation of mixed strands up to six times that length. This construction is feasible without detectable silver nanocluster contaminants. Functional gene parts for the synthesis of DNA- and RNA-based, C-Ag<SUP>+</SUP>-C duplexes in a cell-free system have been constructed in an Escherichia coli expression plasmid and added to the open-source BioBrick Registry, paving the way to realizing the promise of inexpensive industrial production. With appropriate design constraints, this conductive variant of DNA demonstrates promise for use in synthetic biological constructs as a dynamic nucleic acid component and contributes molecular electronic functionality to DNA that is not already found in nature. We propose a viable route to fabricating stable DNA nanowires in cell-free and synthetic biological systems for the production of self-assembling nanoelectronic architectures.",

The validity of the theory extends from the low-frequency lock-in detection up to the sideband-modulation case. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency lock-in detection theory of Goldman, Pifer and Revokatov can be obtained as a special case of the above theory. A connection between the many different modulation treatments in the literature is also established. The simple nonsaturation theory of Halbach is obtained as a special case of ours. Moreover, a generalized sideband-modulation theory is derived. The usual sideband-modulation theory in high resolution NMR follows from this result. The case of low-frequency lock-in detection is treated in somewhat more detail for the so-called rapid-modulation case of Goldman and Revokatov. The results are discussed in connection herewith.",

We found a robust correlation between the magnitude of net horizontal photon transport (H) and its spectral dependence (slope), which is scale-invariant and holds for the entire pixel population of a domain. This was surprising at first given the large degree of spatial inhomogeneity. We prove that the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon is molecular scattering in conjunction with cloud spatial structure. On this basis, we developed a simple parameterization through a single parameter ɛ, which quantifies the characteristic spectral signature of spatial inhomogeneities. In the case we studied, neglecting net horizontal photon transport leads to a local transmittance bias of ±12-19 %, even at the relatively coarse spatial resolution of 20 km. Since three-dimensional effects depend on the spatial context of a given pixel in a nontrivial way, the spectral dimension of this problem may emerge as the starting point for future bias corrections.",

Because the samples contain both nuclear and (unpaired) electron spins, irradiation of the sample with microwaves with a frequency at or near the electron Larmor frequency leads to an enhancement of the nuclear spin polarization via the effect referred to as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This enhancement (at a field of 1.4 T), combined with the effects of isotopic enrichment (14% <SUP>13</SUP>C), makes it possible to measure <SUP>13</SUP>C DNP-CP-MAS spectra within a couple of hours, compared to almost 20 h for the CP-MAS spectra taken at high field without DNP. Data based on DNP-CP-MAS experiments with variable CP-match time or dipolar-dephasing time are shown and discussed in terms of structural models. The cross-polarization signals are rationalized in terms of estimates of the chemical shifts of hydrogenated diamond surfaces; this approach indicates that most of the hydrogens in the polycrystalline sample are at the intergrain boundaries.",

In order to take proper account of the discrepancies between model resolution and sensor footprint, the algorithm takes explicit account of the model subgrid variability, in particular its description of the probability density function of total water (vapor and cloud condensate.) The simulated sensor radiances are then substituted into an operational remote sensing algorithm processing chain to produce a variety of remote sensing products that would normally be produced from actual sensor output. This output can then be used for a wide variety of purposes such as model parameter verification, remote sensing algorithm validation, testing of new retrieval methods and future sensor studies. We show a specific implementation using the GEOS-5 model, the MODIS instrument and the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) Data Collection 5.1 operational remote sensing cloud algorithm processing chain (including the cloud mask, cloud top properties and cloud optical and microphysical properties products). We focus on clouds because they are very important to model development and improvement.",

Creation of artificial lattices that re-create graphene's honeycomb topology, known as artificial graphene, can facilitate the investigation of graphenelike phenomena, such as the existence of massless Dirac fermions, in a tunable system. In this work, the authors present the fabrication of artificial graphene in an ultrahigh quality GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, with lattice period as small as 50 nm, the smallest reported so far for this type of system. Electron-beam lithography is used to define an etch mask with honeycomb geometry on the surface of the sample, and different methodologies are compared and discussed. An optimized anisotropic reactive ion etching process is developed to transfer the pattern into the AlGaAs layer and create the artificial graphene. The achievement of such high-resolution artificial graphene should allow the observation for the first time of massless Dirac fermions in an engineered semiconductor.",

      "abstract": "Multiyear (2014-2021) mapping of supraglacial lakes in Dronning Maud Land (15°W-35°E longitude) reveals large spatiotemporal lake variability. Riiser Larsen, Nivlisen and Roi Baudouin Ice Shelves have large networks storing and transporting meltwater, whereas only isolated ponds are observed on Fimbulisen and Muninisen. Past studies have highlighted the role of katabatic winds in driving melting and lake formation in the region, however no detailed investigation has been carried out concerning foehn winds, despite their demonstrated importance in the Antarctic Peninsula. In this work, we perform an in-depth assessment of foehn and katabatic winds in the region to investigate the connection with meltwater ponds using the regional climate model MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional), run at a spatial resolution of 5 km. Using established methods for foehn detection, we find frequent occurrence of undocumented foehn along the coast of Dronning Maud Land. Foehn events in this region result from the circumpolar easterlies flowing across marginal ice rises and promontories that act as topographic barriers giving rise to foehn on the lee side. Frequent foehn winds occur on the Riiser Larsen, Ekström and eastern Roi Baudouin Ice shelves which lie downwind of the ice promontories of Søråsen, Hålvfarryggen and Riiser-Larsen Halvøya that are &gt; 600 m in height. Low intensity foehn winds are observed on the downwind side of several other ice rises that have relatively lower elevation (~250 m). On the other hand, the mapping of winds following the surface topography show that the influence of katabatic winds is large in the eastern Dronning Maud Land whereas in central and western parts, the flow of katabatic winds is blocked by nunataks, largely reducing their intensity. Comparison with mapped lake extents shows significant meltwater ponding in the areas where foehn winds are frequent, e.g., Riiser Larsen, and widespread ponding where influence of both foehn and katabatics is large, e.g., Roi Baudouin East. These two wind types, together, largely explain the spatial variability of lakes in the region. They also highlight those areas that might be vulnerable to meltwater generation and ponding. These findings will be vital towards modeling future meltwater hydrology in the region, and its potential implications on ice shelf stability.",

      "abstract": "Recent observations suggest that deep convection and water mass transformation in the Irminger Sea southeast of Greenland, together with overflows from the Nordic Seas, may be more important for the variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) than the Labrador Sea. The preconditioning for and triggering of deep convection in the Irminger Sea is strongly associated with topography-induced mesoscale wind phenomena, such as Greenland tip jets, katabatic winds and marine cold air outbreaks. However, the resolution of current coupled climate models is too coarse to capture all the properties of these wind systems or to capture them at all. Here we explore the air-ice-ocean interactions induced by mesoscale wind phenomena in the Irminger Sea in a 1-year global coupled 5km simulation with ICON-ESM. The model is able to capture the complex interactions of the wind field and the ocean. We find that strong downward katabatic winds cause substantial heat loss from the Irminger Sea in addition to Greenland tip jets. The outflowing katabatic winds form narrow streaks of cold air that extend across the entire Irminger basin from southeast Greenland to Iceland. In addition, cold air outbreaks from the sea ice lead to the genesis of mesoscale cyclones, which in turn can cause Greenland tip jets before moving off to the east. All these wind phenomena cause substantial heat loss that preconditions the ocean for deep convection. If these wind systems are not resolved, the water mass transformation in the Irminger Sea could be too weak, contributing to why the Labrador Sea dominates AMOC variability in models. We conclude that resolving these mesoscale wind systems in an Earth system model could have significant implications for deep convection and water mass transformation in the Irminger Sea, and thus for AMOC variability.",

Changing shapes and intensities of warm and cool pockets and development of cliffs and plateaus at minimum temperature epoch are elucidated and also compared with similar aspects for Pune city documented in earlier studies. Dry and wet bulb temperature data obtained by whirling psychrometers in a mobile survey conducted in April 1997 formed the base of analysis. In total 9,9 routes were devised for moving observations to give data for 170 locations within the city region. Results indicate that at night, the core of the city appears as both heat and moisture islands whereas at the time of sunrise as heat and dry islands. Morphological variations in hill slope include barren, vegetated and residential area induced cool katabatic airflow of varying intensity as there has been formation of a cool pool in the first case, linearity in the main heat island in downwind direction in the second case and development of secondary warm pockets in the last one. Situated in a basin-like topography, the city experiences stronger influence of katabatic winds rather than the thermal circulation systems arising from spatial inhomogeneity in thermal and moisture patterns.",

It was found that a shallow but strong temperature inversion was developed at night, and destroyed during the day, resulting in the development of a well-mixed layer. Wind hodographs were quite regular and spiral-like at night, but irregular during the day. The mean wind direction was about 40° to the left, looking downslope, but more downslope at night and more cross-slope during the day.The conclusion was derived that during the polar summer the flow over Antarctica is controlled by the gravitational factor (slope-induced baroclinicity), by the thermal stability (turbulent mixing), and also by the synoptic forcing.",

In Antarctic winter, there is no real tropopause to prevent such descent, hence the quotes in the title: the temperature profile is often that of a radiative equilibrium atmosphere. Such descent would be important because the dryness and low precipitation over the Antarctic Plateau would be less altered during global warming, because there would be an alternative fractionation pathway for H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUP>18</SUP> and HDO in Antarctic ice-cores, and because the ozone budget in the unpolluted troposphere of the southern hemisphere would be significantly different. Each of these features could have a major impact on climate or on the study of climate.",

While some of these sensitivities are purely physically dependent on the configuration of the observed scene, such as unresolved spatial inhomogeneity or 3-D radiative effects - others may have more to do with inherent LUT assumptions, models, and algorithmic decisions [Zhang et al. 2012; Miller, et al. 2016,2018; Cho, et al. 2015]. Recently the MODIS CLDPROP algorithm has been ported to the multi-angle observations obtained by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) instrument as part of the NASA CAMP2Ex field campaign mission- as well as other campaigns RSP made observations during, such as NASA's ORACLES campaign. This dataset from two campaigns that span vastly different cloud regimes offer the opportunity to fully explore the behavior of cloud microphysical retrievals produced by CLDPROP from a multi-angular perspective. We will present this work and lessons learned from the data products in the context of addressing existing studies on bi-spectral cloud microphysical retrieval bias correction [Fu et al. 2018], in addition to extending our general understanding and improving the algorithm development ofpassive bi-spectral cloud retrievals.",

Critical dimension control error budgets for resist linewidth uniformity are determined for logic patterns at 75 and 100 nm ground rules. Image shortening is quantified for 75-125 nm ground rule static random access memory-like patterns, indicating hammerheads added to line ends reduce shortening to acceptable levels for ⩾100 nm ground rules at ⩽17.5 μm gaps.

The BAC-end sequences selected for mapping are ≈1 Mbp apart on the human chromosomes as determined by BLASTN analysis. The map has 3,484 ordered markers, of which 3,204 are anchored in the human genome. Two hundred-and-one homologous synteny blocks (HSBs) were identified, of which 27 are previously undiscovered, 79 are extended, 26 were formed by previously unrecognized breakpoints in 18 previously defined HSBs, and 23 are the result of fusions. The comparative coverage relative to the human genome is ≈91%, or 97% of the theoretical maximum. The positions of 64% of all cattle centromeres and telomeres were reassigned relative to their positions on the previous map, thus facilitating a more detailed comparative analysis of centromere and telomere evolution. As an example of the utility of the high-resolution map, 22 cattle BAC fingerprint contigs were directly anchored to cattle chromosome 19 [Bos taurus, (BTA) 19]. The order of markers on the cattle RH and fingerprint maps of BTA19 and the sequence-based map of human chromosome 17 [Homo sapiens, (HSA) 17] were found to be highly consistent, with only two minor ordering discrepancies between the RH map and fingerprint contigs. The high-resolution Illinois-Texas 5,000-rad RH and comparative maps will facilitate identification of candidate genes for economically important traits, the phylogenomic analysis of mammalian chromosomes, proofing of the BAC fingerprint map and, ultimately, aid the assembly of cattle whole-genome sequence.",

Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) is used as a passivating layer on silicon dioxide substrates, which prevents DNA attachment. Hydrophilic areas, patterned by nanoimprint lithography with the same size and shape of the origami, are formed by selective removal of the HMDS, enabling the assembly of the origami scaffolds in the patterned areas.

      "abstract": "Despite its importance as one of the key radiative properties that determines the impact of upper tropospheric clouds on the radiation balance, ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) has proven to be one of the more challenging properties to retrieve from space-based remote sensing measurements. In particular, optically thin upper tropospheric ice clouds (cirrus) have been especially challenging due to their tenuous nature, extensive spatial scales, and complex particle shapes and light scattering characteristics. The lack of independent validation motivates the investigation presented in this paper, wherein systematic biases between MODIS Collection 5 (C5) and CALIOP Version 3 (V3) unconstrained retrievals of tenuous IOT (&lt; 3) are examined using a month of collocated A-Train observations. An initial comparison revealed a factor of two bias between the MODIS and CALIOP IOT retrievals. This bias is investigated using an infrared (IR) radiative closure approach that compares both products with MODIS IR cirrus retrievals developed for this assessment. The analysis finds that both the MODIS C5 and the unconstrained CALIOP V3 retrievals are biased (high and low, respectively) relative to the IR IOT retrievals. Based on this finding, the MODIS and CALIOP algorithms are investigated with the goal of explaining and minimizing the biases relative to the IR. For MODIS we find that the assumed ice single scattering properties used for the C5 retrievals are not consistent with the mean IR COT distribution. The C5 ice scattering database results in the asymmetry parameter (g) varying as a function of effective radius with mean values that are too large. The MODIS retrievals have been brought into agreement with the IR by adopting a new ice scattering model for Collection 6 (C6) consisting of a modified gamma distribution comprised of a single habit (severely roughened aggregated columns); the C6 ice cloud optical property models have a constant g ~ 0.75 in the mid-visible spectrum, 5-15 % smaller than C5. For CALIOP, the assumed lidar ratio for unconstrained retrievals is fixed at 25 sr for the V3 data products. This value is found to be inconsistent with the constrained (predominantly nighttime) CALIOP retrievals. An experimental data set was produced using a modified lidar ratio of 32 sr for the unconstrained retrievals (an increase of 28 %), selected to provide consistency with the constrained V3 results. These modifications greatly improve the agreement with the IR and provide consistency between the MODIS and CALIOP products. Based on these results the recently released MODIS C6 optical products use the single habit distribution given above, while the upcoming CALIOP V4 unconstrained algorithm will use higher lidar ratios for unconstrained retrievals.",

We use the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2.1/ANT with a high horizontal resolution (27 km), equipped with a drifting snow routine and forced by ERA-Interim (1989-2009) at its lateral and ocean boundaries. Drifting snow sublimation (SU<SUB>ds</SUB>) is significant in Antarctica, especially in the coastal regions (&gt;150 mm water equivalent yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). Integrated over the ice sheet, SU<SUB>ds</SUB> removes ∼6% of the annually precipitated snow. Drifting snow interacts with the atmosphere, as it increases the lower atmospheric moisture content and reduces surface sublimation (SU<SUB>s</SUB>), and leads to increased snowfall in regions where the atmosphere usually is close to saturation. Drifting snow sublimation (SU<SUB>ds</SUB>) is smallest in summer, when katabatic wind speeds are lower and melting and surface sublimation consolidate the snow surface. Compared to a simulation without drifting snow, total sublimation (SU<SUB>ds</SUB> + SU<SUB>s</SUB>) doubles on the grounded ice sheet if drifting snow is considered. Drifting snow erosion is locally significant, but can be neglected on a continent-wide scale.",

It is an intermediate case between fast rotators like Earth and Mars and slow rotators like Venus and Titan. It is also uniquely characterized by a near-surface stratosphere, long radiative timescales and strong N2 condensation flows. Yet, not many observations are available. Numerical climate models are therefore used to explore the atmospheric circulation. Near the surface, local downslope katabatic winds are superimposed on the flows from the subliming ice to the condensing deposits, with a Coriolis turning of the wind. Different general circulation regimes are possible, including superrotation. However, simulations performed with surface conditions most consistent with New Horizons observations suggest that the most likely regime is a global \"retrorotation\" forced by the conservation of angular momentum in the condensation-sublimation flows. Tidal and gravity waves are also present, creating fluctuations in the observed density profiles and the spectacular layering in the haze.",

      "abstract": "One focus of the PIPERS cruise into the Ross Sea ice cover during April-June 2017 was the Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya where joint measurements of air-ice-ocean wave interaction were conducted over twelve days. In Terra Nova Bay, measurements were made in three katabatic wind events each with sustained winds over 35 ms-1 and air temperatures below -15C. Near shore, intense wave fields with wave amplitudes of over 2m and 7-9 sec periods built and large amounts of frazil ice crystals grew. The frazil ice gathered initially into short and narrow plumes that eventually were added laterally to create longer and wider streaks or bands. Breaking waves within these wider streaks were dampened which appeared to enhance the development of pancake ice. Eventually, the open water areas between the streaks sealed off, developing a complete ice cover of 100 percent concentration (80-90 percent pancakes, 20-10 percent frazil) over a wide front (30km). The pancakes continued to grow in diameter and thickness as waves alternately contracted and expanded the ice cover, with the thicker larger floes further diminishing the wave field and lateral motion between pancakes until the initial pancake ice growth ceased. The equilibrium thickness of the ice was 20-30cm in the pancake ice. While the waves had died off however, katabatic wind velocities were sustained and resulted in a wide area of concentrated, rafted, pancake ice that was rapidly advected downstream until the end of the katabatic event. High resolution TerraSar-X radar satellite imagery showed the length of the ice area produced in one single event extended over 300km or ten times the length of the open water area during one polynya event. The TNB polynya is therefore an \"ice factory\" where frazil ice is manufactured into pancake ice floes that are then pushed out of the assembly area and advected, rafted (and occasionally piled up into \"dragon skin\" ice), until the katabatic wind dies off at the coastal source.",

      "abstract": "The response of the Adriatic shelf waters to dominant winter winds is analysed: the bora, which is a cold, katabatic wind blowing from the northeast; and the sirocco, which blows from the southeast and brings warm Mediterranean air. Currents and sea-level changes, caused by momentum exchange at the air-sea interface, are simulated using a three-dimensional numerical model. Numerical predictions are verified through comparison with data collected in the area. It is shown that the bora induces a rather complex response of the Adriatic Sea, with sea levels organized in several lows and highs and the current field dominated by the wind-curl effect. The currents are directed downwind under the bora maxima, upwind under the minima. Simulations of the bora-driven sea levels and currents are supported by results of in situ measurements carried out on the Adriatic shelf. Moreover, they are confirmed by an analysis of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) imagery, showing that during the bora episodes highly-productive Po-influenced waters extend from the river mouth in an offshore direction, due to advection by upwind currents. The sirocco piles up water in the North Adriatic and brings about the occurrence of storm surges along the northern shorelines. This process has been documented amply in the literature. According to the present model, the sirocco-driven currents are controlled by two different mechanisms: bottom slope, supporting the existence of a cyclonic and an anticyclonic gyre in the sea; and wind curl, which is a source of cyclonic vorticity in the basin. The data show that the sirocco may reverse the current usually found along the western coast, when the wind-forced current component becomes stronger than buoyancy-driven residual flow.",

We describe axisymmetric basin-scale circulation driven by heat flux at the shorelines in polar Lake Kilpisjärvi. A dense underflow originating near the shore converges toward the lake center, where it produces warm upwelling and return flow across the bulk of lake water column. The return flow, being subject to Coriolis force, creates a lake-wide anticyclonic gyre with velocities of 2-4 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. While warm underflows are common on ice-covered lakes, the key finding is the basin-scale anticyclonic gyre with warm upwelling in the core. This circulation mechanism provides a key to understanding transport processes in (semi) enclosed basins subject to negative buoyancy flux due to heating (or cooling at temperatures above TMD) at their lateral boundaries.",

The main goal was to understand how the energy used in the melting of snow and ice is delivered to the surface. Many meteorological stations were operated simultaneously on the ice cap, at almost all of which profile measurements were made. Cable balloons and radiosondes were used to probe the vertical structure of the boundary layer. It appears that the flow near the surface is katabatic most of the time, with the height of the wind maximum varying between a few metres and a few tens of metres. It is only during the passage of intense storms that the katabatic wind in the melt zone disappears. Global radiation increases significantly with altitude. Surface albedo varies enormously in space and time, with very low values (≈ 0.1) being found at many places because of the melt out of volcanic ash layers. If we consider the total melt in the period 22 May-31 August 1996, we conclude that radiation typically provides two-thirds of the melt energy, and turbulent exchange of heat one-third. At locations high on the glacier, turbulent exchange becomes less significant.",

      "abstract": "The Hadley Centre climate model version HadAM2 is used to study the sensitivity of modelled Antarctic climate to the parametrization of surface and boundary-layer heat fluxes under stable conditions. Specifically, the impact of changing the dependence of surface exchange coefficients and eddy diffusivities on the Richardson number is investigated. Three alternative parametrizations are implemented; in all of these the exchange coefficients decrease more rapidly with increasing stability than they do in the standard parametrization used in the model. When only the surface flux scheme is replaced by one of these alternatives, cooling is largely restricted to the surface, with some compensating warming occurring at the lowest atmospheric levels, and little change is seen in the low-level wind field over Antarctica. If alternative schemes are implemented both at the surface and in the boundary layer, widespread cooling occurs at the surface and at the lowest one or two atmospheric levels. The increased negative buoyancy thus generated causes significant increases in the speed of katabatic winds blowing down the coastal slopes of Antarctica. Colder and stronger offshore winds lead to increased cooling of the Antarctic coastal waters. In a coupled model, this could impact on the production of sea ice and ocean-bottom water. The modelled temperature changes appear to show both a direct response to changed boundary-layer heat-flux divergence and an indirect response as a result of the consequent changes to the low-level circulation.",

      "abstract": "Polynyas are large, seasonal openings in sea ice that allow for the transfer of gas, heat, and momentum between the atmosphere and an ocean otherwise sealed off by ice. Many occur along the coasts of Antarctica, where katabatic winds push ice seaward, allowing new ice to form. The ongoing brine rejection as well as exposure to the cold atmosphere increases the density of surface water within the polynya, forming a water mass known as High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW). HSSW sinks and mixes with other water masses to eventually become Antarctic Bottom Water, a water mass that drives the overturning of ocean nutrients, carbon, and heat on a global scale. The preconditioning and formation mechanisms that control HSSW production are not well constrained, highlighting the need for comprehensive and high-resolution observational studies of this complex Antarctic air-ice-ocean system. Here, we utilize measurements of salinity, temperature, water velocity, ocean surface waves, and sea ice thickness from a mooring deployed in the Terra Nova Bay polynya from February 2017 through February 2018 in order to investigate HSSW on timescales ranging from sub-hourly to interseasonal. The mooring was uniquely instrumented throughout the water column to capture the processes surrounding HSSW formation and transport at high temporal resolution, and is unprecedented in its in-situ measurements of the near surface (~50m water depth) during the austral winter, when HSSW formation occurs. It was located in the direct path of katabatic winds (via the Reeves Glacier) and in line with the Automatic Weather Station Manuela, which provides key measurements of wind speed and other meteorological variables. We identify polynya opening events using both in-situ measurements of sea ice thickness and MODIS infrared and AMSR2 passive microwave satellite imagery, and present selected events as case studies to illustrate the mechanisms and response times of HSSW production. We compare these opening events to characterize how HSSW production evolves over the course of the year and additionally test the ability of mixed layer models to capture the observed HSSW properties and response times.",

In addition to their numerical advantages (high precision, locality, fast algorithms for operator application, linear scaling with respect to system size, to mention a few), they provide a framework that narrows the gap between the theoretical formalism of the fundamental equations and the practical implementation in a working code. This realization led us to the development of the Python library called VAMPyR (Very Accurate Multiresolution Python Routines). VAMPyR encodes the binding to a C++ library for multiwavelet calculations (algebra and integral and differential operator application) and exposes the required functionality to write a simple Python code to solve, among others, the Hartree–Fock equations, the generalized Poisson equation, the Dirac equation, and the time-dependent Schrödinger equation up to any predefined precision. In this study, we will outline the main features of multiresolution analysis using multiwavelets and we will describe the design of the code. A few illustrative examples will show the code capabilities and its interoperability with other software platforms.",

Many considerations that must be addressed in designing studies of consumer product emissions are similar to those addressed in studies of the emissions from building materials and combustion appliances. These similarities are discussed and, in addition, the considerations unique to studies of consumer product emissions are discussed with reference to an ongoing study of consumer products that contain methylene chloride. These unique considerations include bulk chemical analysis, the form of the product (e.g. liquid, aerosol or paste) and the related consumer usage pattern. The issue of personal exposure of the product user vs the average area concentration resulting from product use must be considered, as well as the challenge of incorporating results into predictive models that adequately treat the effect of different usage patterns. Finally, post-study considerations, such as exploring new issues discovered in the study, studying similar products, and validating predictive models through extension into field studies are summarized.",

Immunological assays using different antibodies were applied to test if K+ deficiency affects the amount of immunodetectable PM H+‑ATPases in the stem tissue. The monoclonal antibody clone 46 E5 B11 revealed an increased abundance of PM H+‑ATPases under conditions of low K+ supply, and immunolabelling experiments showed that this increase was restricted to vessel‑associated cells (VACs) of the wood ray parenchyma. Replacement of the monoclonal antibody by a polyclonal antibody against PM H+‑ATPase gave a specific immunoreactivity on blots as well as tissue sections too, but the labelling intensity showed no difference between plants with low or full‑strength K+ supply. Measurements of extracellular H+ concentrations using non‑invasive, H+‑selective microelectrodes revealed a lowering of the pH at the surface of VACs and an enhancement of net efflux of H+ in plants grown with low K+ supply. The present results indicate an up‑regulation of specific isoforms of the PM H+‑ATPase in VACs under K+‑deficient conditions and suggest a key role for these PM H+‑ATPases in unloading K+ from the xylem stream.",

These katabatic winds are driven primarily by thermal gradients but can be exacerbated by northerly flow associated with upper level troughs passing through the western U.S. In this paper, we show that the fire danger associated with the passage of upper level troughs can be further increased by the formation of deep tropopause folds that transport extremely dry ozone-rich air from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere to the surface. Stratospheric intrusions can thus increase surface ozone both directly through transport and indirectly through their influence on wildland fires. We illustrate this situation with the example of the Springs Fire, which burned nearly 25,000 acres in Ventura County during May 2013.",

      "abstract": "Five winter months (April-August 1988) of thermal infrared satellite images were examined to investigate the occurrence of dark (warm) signatures across the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic continent. These features are inferred to be generated by katabatic winds that descend from southern Marie Byrd Land and then blow horizontally across the ice shelf. Significant mass is added to this airstream by katabatic winds blowing from the major glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains from East Antarctica. These negatively buoyant katabatic winds can reach the northwestern edge of the shelf - a horizontal propagation distance of up to 1,000 km - 14 percent of the time. Where the airstream crosses from the ice shelf to the ice-covered Ross Sea, a prominent coastal polynya is formed. Because the downslope buoyancy force is near zero over the Ross Ice Shelf, the northwestward propagation of the katabatic air mass requires pressure gradient support. The study shows that the extended horizontal propagation of this atmospheric density current occurred in conjunction with the passage of synoptic cyclones over the southern Amundsen Sea. These cyclones can strengthen the pressure gradient in the interior of West Antarctica and make the pressure field favorable for northwestward movement of the katabatic winds from West Antarctica across the ice shelf in a geostrophic direction. The glacier winds from East Antarctica are further accelerated by the synoptic pressure gradient, usually undergo abrupt adjustment beyond the exit to the glacier valley, and merge into the mountain-parallel katabatic air mass.",

      "abstract": "Loess is extensive in central Alaska, but there are uncertainties about its source and the direction of paleo winds that deposited it. Both northerly and southerly winds have been inferred. The most likely sources of loess are the Tanana River (south), the Nenana River (southeast), and the Yukon River (north). Late Quaternary loess in central Alaska has immobile trace-element compositions (Cr/Sc, Th/Ta, Th/Sc, Th/U, Eu/Eu*, Gd<SUB>N</SUB>/Yb<SUB>N</SUB>) that indicate derivation mostly from the Tanana River. However, other ratios (As/Sb, Zr/Hf, La<SUB>N</SUB>/Yb<SUB>N</SUB>) and quantitative modeling indicate that the Yukon River was also a source. During the last glacial period, there may have been a longer residence time of the Siberian and Canadian high-pressure cells, along with a strengthened Aleutian low-pressure cell. This would have generated regional-scale northeasterly winds and explains derivation of loess from the Yukon River. However, superimposed upon this synoptic-scale circulation, there may have been strong, southerly katabatic winds from expanded glaciers on the northern flank of the Alaska Range. These winds could have provided eolian silt from the Tanana River. Yukon River and Tanana River sediments are highly calcareous, whereas Fairbanks-area loess is not. This suggests that carbonate leaching in loess kept ahead of sedimentation and that late Quaternary loess in central Alaska was deposited relatively slowly.",

      "abstract": "Surface albedo data from several Antarctic sites were compared to determine spatial and temporal variability in albedo. The highest degree of variability was observed at Hells Gate Station on the Ross Sea coast. The temperature close to the melting point and the reduced katabatic winds during summer allowed a strong metamorphism of the snow. At Neumayer, a coastal station by the Weddell Sea, snowfall and drifting snow were more frequent, and the surface albedo was constantly high. The albedo increased by an average of 0.07 from clear days to days with snowfall and overcast sky. Surprisingly, the hourly variation in albedo at Hells Gate Station showed a trend similar to the one observed at Neumayer Station and at Dome Concordia Station on the high plateau, when only those days with fresh snow at the surface were considered. The albedo steadily decreased during the day for solar zenith angles less than 80°. Snow metamorphism, sublimation during the day, and refreezing and/or crystal formation/precipitation during the night can explain the observed trend. To represent the daily trend in albedo over ice and fresh snow, we propose two parameterizations, which can be easily applied over other Arctic and Antarctic sites in summer. Small- and large-scale surface roughness elements can result in distortion in the measured albedo. The data at Reeves Névé Station show the effect produced on the albedo by changing slightly the sampling area immediately over a sastruga.",

The results have to be interpreted and compared with respect to the regional meteorological conditions. In this study the 3-hourly synoptic surface observations taken at the three stations between 1991 and 1995, as well as the daily upper air soundings from 1993, are analyzed to describe the aspects of station climatologies relevant for the air and snowfall chemistry measurements discussed in the papers of this special section. Although the three stations are comparable, being situated close to the coastline of Antarctica, the meteorological conditions differ. While at Dumont d'Urville katabatic winds cause predominant strong and relatively dry surface winds from the interior of Antarctica, Neumayer and Halley are frequently influenced by easterly winds associated mostly with eastward moving cyclones. From April through October the wind field above 5 km is governed by a circumpolar vortex with westerly winds increasing in intensity with height. Dumont d'Urville represents a station at the edge of this vortex with extreme stratospheric wind velocities up to above 50 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Neumayer and Halley are mostly situated within the vortex and isolated from air masses advecting from lower latitudes into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere during the Austral winter.",

Our analysis shows a marked division of the atmosphere into two characteristic regions: (i) a highly turbulent boundary layer {(0-220 m)} associated with a strong temperature inversion and wind shear, and (ii) a very stable free atmosphere. The mean seeing, averaged over 15 balloon flights, was measured to be 1.86arcsec , of which the free atmosphere component was only 0.37arcsec . The seeing from ~ 200 m upward is superior to the leading mid-latitude sites (e.g. \\cite[Fuchs 1995]{fuchs}; \\cite[Roddier et al. 1990]{roddier2}) by almost a factor of two. The results are in good agreement with optical seeing data obtained by a differential image motion monitor on three of the five occasions when the two measurements were performed simultaneously. The boundary layer winds are of katabatic origin, and so we may consider the possibility of exceptional seeing conditions from surface level at other locations on the plateau such as Domes A and C, where there is little or no katabatic wind. In addition, the proximity of the optical turbulence to the focus of a telescope situated at ground level is a highly favourable situation for the use of adaptive optics, since the wavefront spatial coherence scale is related to the altitude of the turbulent layers producing the image distortion. Some comparisons are made between the relevant adaptive optics parameters measured at the South Pole and Cerro Paranal, one of the best mid-latitude sites.",

Throughout the winter the area of open water fluctuated quasi-periodically with a period of 15-20 days. Average polyna area was 1000 km<SUP>2</SUP>; maximum area was approximately 5000 km<SUP>2</SUP>. Fluctuations were associated with the magnitude of the zonal geostrophic wind, with a closing polynya being related to strong, persistent easterlies. An open, or opening, polynya was linked with persistent westerly or weakk easterly winds and the probable descent of adiabatically warming, drift-bearing air from the plateau. This air enters Terra Nova Bay through the Reeves Glacier valley, probably as katabatic surface winds. Polynya formation was probably due to the action of these winds on the coastal pack ice, while areal fluctuations reflected the interplay between the katabatic winds and synnoptic scale motions advecting ice toward and away from the bay.",

Geomorphic evidence and dune field pattern analysis of dune crest length, spacing, defect density, and orientation indicates that the pattern is complex, representing two constructional generations of dunes. The oldest and best-organized generation forms the primary crestlines and is transverse to circumpolar easterly winds. Gross bed form-normal analysis of the younger pattern of crestlines indicates that it emerged with both circumpolar easterly winds and NE winds and is reworking the older pattern. Mapping of secondary flow fields over the dunes indicates that the most recent transporting winds were from the NE. The younger pattern appears to represent an influx of sediment to the dune field associated with the development of the Olympia Cavi reentrant, with NE katabatic winds channeling through the reentrant. A model of the pattern reformation based upon the reconstructed primary winds and resulting secondary flow fields shows that the development of the secondary pattern is controlled by the boundary condition of the older dune topography.",

      "abstract": "The system of operational diagnosis and forecast (SODaF) is presented for hydrometeorological characteristics of Kara and Pechora Seas, which is implemented in the N.N.Zubov State Oceanography Institute (SOI). It includes the computation of atmospheric forcing using the WRF model, computation of currents, sea level, temperature, salinity and sea ice using the model INMOM, and computation of wind wave parameters using Russian Wind Wave Model (RWWM).The results of the verification are presented including simulated hydrometeocharacteristics obtained by SODaF for Kara and Pechora Seas. As well, the retrospective simulation was performed for thermohydrodynamical characteristics of these seas for the ice-free period of 2003-2012. The important features of circulation in Kara and Pechora Seas and the structure of water exchange between them in the ice-free period are shown. The use of non-hydrostatic atmospheric model WRF allows one to reproduce katabatic winds formed over the glaciers. In general, the direction and speed of katabatic winds are fairly permanent. In accordance with the nature of katabatic winds, they are intensified from warm to cold period that is well manifested in the wind map for August. The basis of the Kara Sea circulation is NewLand, Yamal and Ob-Yenisey currents, which are well reproduced with the INMOM. It is shown that the main contribution to the monthly mean circulation of Kara and Pechora seas is made by wind currents. In the western part of the Kara Sea between the mainland and the New Land in the fall the pronounced cyclonic circulation is formed that is typical for closed seas. The main components of the circulation are the NewLand and Yamal currents flowing respectively along the eastern coast of NewLand and the western coast of the Yamal Peninsula.It is caused by regional winds directed from the \"cold\" land to the \"warm\" sea. In summer,such a circulation is broken along the coast of the mainland, so that the Yamal flow is reduced. This happensbecause hte significant contribution to the wind circulation is made by movement of air masses from the\"cold\" sea to the\"warm\" land.The same effect influences the intensification of the Ob-Yenisei current in autumn and its weakening in the summer. Katabatic winds form anticyclonic (in relation to the islands) circulation around NewLand and NorthLand islands. The most prominent structure of the circulation is NewLand current. Water exchange through the Kara Gate in the ice-free period is proceeding so that the outflow from Cara to Pechora Sea occurs along the New Land, and at the opposite coast of the Kara Gate, on the contrary, the inflow in the Kara Sea appears. Outflow is formed by NewLand current. This occurs not only in the surface layer, but also over the whole depth, as indicated by the se level distribution. At the same time, outflow from the Kara Sea in the ice-free period prevails over inflow.",

      "abstract": "For procellariiform seabirds, wind and morphology are crucial determinants of flight costs and flight speeds. During chick-rearing, parental seabirds commute frequently to provision their chicks, and their body mass typically changes between outbound and return legs. In Antarctica, the characteristic diurnal katabatic winds, which blow stronger in the mornings, form a natural experimental setup to investigate flight behaviors of commuting seabirds in response to wind conditions. We GPS-tracked three closely related species of sympatrically breeding Antarctic fulmarine petrels, which differ in wing loading and aspect ratio, and investigated their flight behavior in response to wind and changes in body mass. Such information is critical for understanding how species may respond to climate change. All three species reached higher ground speeds (i.e., the speed over ground) under stronger tailwinds, especially on return legs from foraging. Ground speeds decreased under stronger headwinds. Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica; intermediate body mass, highest wing loading, and aspect ratio) responded stronger to changes in wind speed and direction than cape petrels (Daption capense; lowest body mass, wing loading, and aspect ratio) or southern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialoides; highest body mass, intermediate wing loading, and aspect ratio). Birds did not adjust their flight direction in relation to wind direction nor the maximum distance from their nests when encountering headwinds on outbound commutes. However, birds appeared to adjust the timing of commutes to benefit from strong katabatic winds as tailwinds on outbound legs and avoid strong katabatic winds as headwinds on return legs. Despite these adaptations to the predictable diurnal wind conditions, birds frequently encountered unfavorably strong headwinds, possibly as a result of weather systems disrupting the katabatics. How the predicted decrease in Antarctic near-coastal wind speeds over the remainder of the century will affect flight costs and breeding success and ultimately population trajectories remains to be seen.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we use output of a high-resolution general circulation model (ECHAM-3 T106, resolution 1.1°×1.1°) to study the spatial and temporal variation of sublimation on Antarctica. First, we compare model results with available observations of sublimation rates. The yearly cycle, with small latent heat fluxes during the winter, is well reproduced, and the agreement with sparsely available spot observations is fair. The model results suggest that a significant 10-15% of the annual precipitation over Antarctica is lost through sublimation and that sublimation plays an important role in the formation of blue ice areas. A preliminary analysis of the atmospheric boundary layer moisture budget shows that the spatial variation of sublimation in the coastal zone of East Antarctica can be explained by variations of horizontal advection of dry air. Dry air advection, and thus surface sublimation, is enhanced in areas where katabatic winds are strong and have a large downslope component and where the Antarctic topography drops suddenly from the plateau to the coastal zone. In areas where horizontal advection is small, like the plateau and the large ice shelves, special conditions must be met to make significant sublimation at the surface possible.",

      "abstract": "Near-surface air temperature variability and the reliability of temperature extrapolation within glacierized regions are important issues for hydrological and glaciological studies that remain elusive because of the scarcity of high-elevation observations. Based on air temperature data in 2019 collected from 12 automatic weather stations, 43 temperature loggers, and 6 national meteorological stations in 6 different catchments, this study presents air temperature variability in different glacierized and nonglacierized regions and assesses the robustness of different temperature extrapolations to reduce errors in melt estimation. The results show high spatial variability in temperature lapse rates (LRs) in different climatic contexts, with the steepest LRs located on the cold and dry northwestern Tibetan Plateau and the lowest LRs located on the warm and humid monsoonal-influenced southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Near-surface air temperatures in high-elevation glacierized regions of the western and central Tibetan Plateau are less influenced by katabatic winds and thus can be linearly extrapolated from off-glacier records. In contrast, the local katabatic winds prevailing on the temperate glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau exert pronounced cooling effects on the ambient air temperature, and thus, on-glacier air temperatures are significantly lower than that in elevation-equivalent nonglacierized regions. Consequently, linear temperature extrapolation from low-elevation nonglacierized stations may lead to as much as 40% overestimation of positive degree-days, particularly with respect to large glaciers with a long-flowline distances and significant cooling effects. These findings provide noteworthy evidence that the different LRs and relevant cooling effects on high-elevation glaciers under distinct climatic regimes should be carefully accounted for when estimating glacier melting on the Tibetan Plateau.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing fissure eruption in Holuhraun associated with the volcanic unrest in Bárðarbunga, is unique among recent eruptions in Iceland for its high emission rates of volcanic gases. The plume is relatively ash free, but predominantly a bent over vapour plume and its height depends mainly on the atmospheric conditions at the eruption site. CO2 and SO2 are abundant in the primarily water vapor plume with lower concentrations of H2S, HCl and HF. During the first month and a half the preliminary SO2 flux was ~400 kg/s with some days greater than 1000 kg/s. The gas is dispersed from the eruption and transported by wind, and can lead to high pollution levels in exposed populated areas in Iceland. During high wind events and when nearby weather systems lead to rapid change in wind directions the local population has not been much affected by the emission, as the gas is transported off land and/or the pollution plume is narrow and moves around. However, during certain conditions, usually light winds and low-level temperature inversions, the concentration of gas builds up at the eruption site and then either flows down from the highlands with katabatic wind or is advected from the eruption site when the synoptic situation changes. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, high concentrations of SO2 can be transported in the boundary layer and have been detected at ground level in populated areas. Here we describe one such event, the event of 26 and 27 October 2014, when the village Höfn, in southeast-Iceland, experienced gas concentrations exceeding 14000 µg/m3, a concentration considered hazardous to health. We describe the weather conditions prior and during the event as well as the gas dispersion.",

Gale Crater, the landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), hosts a 5-km-high sedimentary mound (Mount Sharp/Aeolis Mons). Hypotheses for mound formation include evaporitic, lacustrine, fluviodeltaic, and aeolian processes, but the origin and original extent of Gale’s mound is unknown. Here we show new measurements of sedimentary strata within the mound that indicate ∼3° outward dips oriented radially away from the mound center, inconsistent with the first three hypotheses. Moreover, although mounds are widely considered to be erosional remnants of a once crater-filling unit, we find that the Gale mound’s current form is close to its maximal extent. Instead we propose that the mound’s structure, stratigraphy, and current shape can be explained by growth in place near the center of the crater mediated by wind-topography feedbacks. Our model shows how sediment can initially accrete near the crater center far from crater-wall katabatic winds, until the increasing relief of the resulting mound generates mound-flank slope winds strong enough to erode the mound. The slope wind enhanced erosion and transport (SWEET) hypothesis indicates mound formation dominantly by aeolian deposition with limited organic carbon preservation potential, and a relatively limited role for lacustrine and fluvial activity. Morphodynamic feedbacks between wind and topography are widely applicable to a range of sedimentary and ice mounds across the Martian surface, and possibly other planets.",

Surface winds are very weak (average wind speed is appoximately 2 m/s), and strong temperature inversions (also in excess of 10 degrees) are often observed near the ground and in the boundary layer. Moreover, the circulation in the lower troposphere is often affected by small scale phenomena such as sea breeze, mountain breeze, katabatic winds and surface temperature inversions. Since Po Valley is a densely populated and heavily industrialised area, air pollution is a major issue, and day to day pollutant concentrations are tightly linked with meteorological conditions. To schematically characterize the complex surface wind patterns in Po Valley, two classifications are performed with cluster analysis techniques: a large scale synoptic classification of weather types (WTs), and a wind pattern (WPs) classification focused on the south-eastern Po Valley. The link between WTs and WPs is investigated, and the statistical properties of other meteorological variables and pollutant concentrations are studied in connection with WTs and WPs. The classifications of WTs and WPs are finally used to assess the representativeness in time of the data collected during the intensive observation period of project Pegasos in summer 2012.",

Based on simulations performed with the IPSL Venus Global Climate Model, the possible structure and characteristics of Venus' planetary boundary layer (PBL) are investigated. The vertical profile of the potential temperature in the deepest 10 km above the surface and its diurnal variations are controlled by radiative and dynamical processes. The model predicts a diurnal cycle for the PBL activity, with a stable nocturnal PBL while convective activity develops during daytime. The diurnal convective PBL is strongly correlated with surface solar flux and is maximum around noon and in low latitude regions. It typically reaches less than 2 km above the surface, but its vertical extension is much higher over high elevations, and more precisely over the western flanks of elevated terrains. This correlation is explained by the impact of surface winds, which undergo a diurnal cycle with downward katabatic winds at night and upward anabatic winds during the day along the slopes of high-elevation terrains. The convergence of these daytime anabatic winds induces upward vertical winds, that are responsible for the correlation between height of the convective boundary layer and topography.",

The sensitivity of global and regional N<SUB>r</SUB>, S<SUB>r</SUB>, and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> to 20 % and 40 % individual and collective reductions in anthropogenic emissions of NH<SUB>3</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and SO<SUB>x</SUB> (with respect to a 2015 baseline) is investigated using the EMEP MSC-W (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesizing Centre - West) atmospheric chemistry transport model with WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) meteorology. Regional comparisons reveal that the individual emissions reduction has multiple co-benefits and small disbenefits on different species, and those effects are highly geographically variable. A 40 % NH<SUB>3</SUB> emission reduction decreases regional average NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations by 47 %-49 % but only decreases NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> by 18 % in Euro_Medi, 15 % in East Asia, 12 % in North America, and 4 % in South Asia. This order follows the regional ammonia richness. A disbenefit is the increased SO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations in these regions (10 %-16 % for 40 % reductions) because reduced NH<SUB>3</SUB> levels decrease SO<SUB>2</SUB> deposition through altering atmospheric acidity. A 40 % NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reduction reduces NO<SUB>x</SUB> concentrations in East Asia by 45 %, Euro_Medi and North America by ∼ 38 %, and South Asia by 22 %, whilst the regional order is reversed for fine NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>, which is related to enhanced O<SUB>3</SUB> levels in East Asia (and also, but by less, in Euro_Medi) and decreased O<SUB>3</SUB> levels in South Asia (and also, but by less, in North America). Consequently, the oxidation of NO<SUB>x</SUB> to NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> and of SO<SUB>2</SUB> to SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> is enhanced in East Asia but decreased in South Asia, which causes a less effective decrease in NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> and even an increase in SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> in East Asia but quite the opposite in South Asia. For regional policy making, it is thus vital to reduce three precursors together to minimize such adverse effects. A 40 % SO<SUB>x</SUB> emission reduction is slightly more effective in reducing SO<SUB>2</SUB> (42 %-45 %) than SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>2-</SUP> (34 %-38 %), whilst the disbenefit is that it yields a ∼ 12 % increase in total NH<SUB>3</SUB> deposition in the four regions, which further threatens ecosystem diversity. This work also highlights important messages for policy makers concerning the mitigation of PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>. More emissions controls focusing on NH<SUB>3</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB> are necessary for regions with better air quality, such as northern Europe and eastern North America. In East Asia, the three individual reductions are equally effective, whilst in South Asia only SO<SUB>x</SUB> reduction is currently effective. The geographically varying non-one-to-one proportionality of chemical responses of N<SUB>r</SUB>, S<SUB>r</SUB>, and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> to emissions reductions revealed by this work show the importance of both prioritizing emissions strategies in different regions and combining several precursor reductions together to maximize the policy effectiveness.",

In this work, we report the achievement of electronic bands of the honeycomb topology with the period as low as 40 nm on the nano-patterned modulation-doped AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells. Resonant inelastic light scattering spectra reveal peaks which are interpreted as combined electronic transitions between subbands of the quantum well confinement with a change in the AG band index. Spectra lineshapes are explained by joint density of states obtained from the calculated AG electron band structures. These results provide a basis for further advancements in AG physics.",

Here, we aimed to compare the effects of crop (lettuce [Lactuca sativa L.] or radish [Raphanus sativus L.]), soil amendment type (inorganic fertilizer, raw dairy manure, composted dairy manure, or no amendment), and prior antibiotic use history (no antibiotics during previous lactation cycles vs. manure mixed from cows administered pirlimycin or cephapirin) of manure-derived amendments on the incidence of culturable antibiotic-resistant fecal coliforms in agricultural soils through a controlled field-plot experiment. Antibiotic-resistant culturable fecal coliforms were recoverable from soils across all treatments immediately after application, although persistence throughout the experiment varied by antibiotic class and time. The magnitude of observed coliform counts differed by soil amendment type. Compost-amended soils had the highest levels of cephalosporin-resistant fecal coliforms, regardless of whether the cows from which the manure was derived were administered antibiotics. Samples from control plots or those treated with inorganic fertilizer trended toward lower counts of resistant coliforms, although these differences were not statistically significant. No statistical differences were observed between soils that grew leafy (lettuce) versus rooted (radish) crops. Only pirlimycin was detectable past amendment application in raw manure-amended soils, dissipating 12 to 25% by Day 28. Consequently, no quantifiable correlations between coliform count and antibiotic magnitude could be identified. This study demonstrates that antibiotic-resistant fecal coliforms can become elevated in soils receiving manure-derived amendments, but that a variety of factors likely contribute to their long-term persistence under typical field conditions.Core Ideas Pirlimycin was only detected in soils amended with raw dairy manure. Persistence of ARBs in soil was dependent on antibiotic class and time. Compost-amended soils had the highest levels of fecal coliforms resistant to cephalosporins. Antibiotic presence may not be the sole driver of resistance, as ARBs were found in all soils.",

The manifold manifestation of inhomogeneous broadening of this band in emission, excitation, polarization, kinetics and degradation supports the model in which porous silicon is treated as a network of crystallites connected via an oxide interface. Spectral inhomogeneties of the red-orange band can be described in terms of varying shape and size of silicon clusters. The polarization of emission is explained by coexistence of dot-like and wire-like entities, i.e. spherical and non-spherical clusters. The relative weight of these species determines the polarization degree, whereas the kinetics are controlled by the transport of excitations among the clusters. The decay is modeled by a modified stretched exponential function with the local lifetime, the migration lifetime, and a scaling factor. The latter is determined by the dimensionality of the space available for migration which was found to be close to but less than unity. On the nanosecond range two distinct bands in the blue-green region are evaluated that need further studies for interpretation. Generally, arguments are proposed in favor of a quantum confinement origin of the red-orange band and a bridge between quantum-wire and quantum-dot models is provided.",

The model is based on the findings of a multidisiciplinary research program, conducted in Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia. Different management strategies can be compared on the basis of the short- and long-term consequences. Land-use change has been included in RaMCo in view of the impacts of land-based human activities on the marine environment. The key aspect of the model is a combination of the temporal dynamics of land-use change on the regional (macro-level) scale and spatial dynamics on the local (micro-level) scale. Constrained cellular automata are used to integrate both scale levels. The state changes of the cells depend on the consistency with the macro-scale model, local geographical conditions, and interaction with neighboring cells. In this paper, we discuss the underlying theoretical assumptions of the macro-scale and micro-scale models, some characteristic results for land-use change in the study area, and the validation problem.",

Utilizing synchronized IR laser and x-ray pulses, photoelectron sideband generation up to the sixth order is observed. A significant material-dependent variation of the LAPE response has not been predicted by previous theoretical models, to the best of our knowledge. The observed phenomena are semiquantitatively reproduced by considering distinct dynamic dielectric responses of the two materials.

Thin, low-level clouds - ubiquitous in the Arctic - are challenging to detect and retrieve with passive imagery. To quantify the ensuing uncertainties in the surface energy budget, this study validates MODIS-derived spectral and broadband shortwave irradiances above and below clouds with aircraft observations from NASA's 2014 Arctic Radiation-IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE) in the Beaufort Sea, specifically using the upwelling and downwelling spectral and broadband irradiance measured by the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) and the Broadband Radiometer system (BBR). In addition to MODIS cloud retrievals and surface albedo from SSFR, we used temperature and humidity data from in-situ profiles and reanalysis (MERRA). We found that the primary error in MODIS-derived irradiance fields for this study stems from undetected clouds, rather than from the retrieved cloud properties themselves. For the analyzed cases, about 22% of clouds remained undetected (cloud optical thickness less than 0.5). If clouds are detected, the optical thickness from the MODIS \"1621\" cloud product is consistent with the reflected and transmitted irradiance observations. The surface albedo and water vapor are secondary error sources. We show that passive imagery cloud detection could be improved through an Arctic-specific multi-pixel/multi-spectral/multi-overpass approach. Regardless of the cloud retrieval method, there is a need for an operational imagery-based surface albedo product for the polar regions that adequately captures its temporal, spatial, and spectral variability. This need was one of the motivations for proposing a new aircraft field mission: ARCSIX (Arctic radiation-cloud-aerosol surface interaction experiment). We will briefly describe the vision for this effort as documented in a community white paper to NASA.",

Structural analysis and characterization of the material suggest that BH4 groups and PS4 may belong to the same molecular structure, where Cl ions interplay to accommodate the structural unit. Thanks to its conductivity, ductility and electrochemical stability (up to 5 V, Au vs. Li+/Li), this new electrolyte is successfully tested in battery cells operated with a cathode material (layered TiS2, theo. capacity 239 mAh g-1) and Li anode resulting in 93% capacity retention (10 cycles) and notable cycling stability under the current density 12 mA g-1 (0.05C-rate) at 501C.

A comparison of three methods shows satisfactory agreement, especially in the weekly average of sublimation in the 1977-1978 summer, while condensation is insignificantly small. Condensation prevailed from the middle of April to the middle of September and sublimation in the remainder of 1977. The annual amounts of condensation and sublimation in 1977 are estimated to be 0.6 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP> and 5.4 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, respectively. The daily amount of sublimation showed its maximum of 92 mg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> on December 22, 1977, at the summer solstice. The annual amount of sublimation much affected the annual net accumulation of 5.8 g. The sublimation and condensation contributed in the formation of glazed surface consisting of multilayered ice crusts. This glazed surface is representative in the katabatic wind region in Mizuho Plateau, and the structure of the ice crust reflects the mass balance due to sublimation and condensation on both sides of the crust. Sublimation rate varies with the direction of the sloping faces of sastrugi, being the maximum on the north-facing slope, which receives the maximum solar radiation.",

      "abstract": "HiRISE images of Mars with ground sampling down to 25 cm/pixel show that the dust-rich mantle covering the surfaces of the Tharsis Montes is organized into ridges whose form and distribution are consistent with formation by aeolian saltation. Other dusty areas near the volcanoes and elsewhere on the planet exhibit a similar morphology. The material composing these \"reticulate\" bedforms is constrained by their remote sensing properties and the threshold curve combined with the saltation/suspension boundary, both of which vary as a function of elevation (atmospheric pressure), particle size, and particle composition. Considering all of these factors, dust aggregates are the most likely material composing these bedforms. We propose that airfall dust on and near the volcanoes aggregates in situ over time, maybe due to electrostatic charging followed by cementation by salts. The aggregates eventually reach a particle size at which saltation is possible. Aggregates on the flanks are transported downslope by katabatic winds and form linear and \"accordion\" morphologies. Materials within the calderas and other depressions remain trapped and are subjected to multidirectional winds, forming an interlinked \"honeycomb\" texture. In many places on and near the volcanoes, light-toned, low thermal inertia yardangs and indurated surfaces are present. These may represent \"duststone\" formed when aggregates reach a particle size below the threshold curve, such that they become stabilized and subsequently undergo cementation.",

      "abstract": "The turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes are important components of the surface energy balance over glaciers in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, contributing over half the energy available for ablation during large melt events. To calculate these terms confidently in glacier mass-balance models it is essential to use appropriate parameterizations for surface roughness and atmospheric stability. Eddy covariance measurements at Brewster Glacier were obtained over an ice surface to help facilitate an assessment of the calculation of the turbulent heat fluxes. The roughness length for momentum was found to be 3.6 x 10−3m, while the roughness lengths for temperature and humidity were two orders of magnitude smaller, in agreement with surface renewal theory. A Monte Carlo approach was used to assess the uncertainty in turbulent heat fluxes calculated using the bulk aerodynamic method. It was found that input-data and roughness-length uncertainty could not explain underestimates of observed sensible heat fluxes during periods with low wind speed and large temperature gradients. During these periods a katabatic wind speed maximum alters the formulation of the turbulent exchange coefficient to that typically observed in a neutral atmosphere and this has implications for glacier mass-balance sensitivity.",

It is distributed in a simplistic manner in most glacier melt models by using constant linear lapse rates, which poorly represent the actual spatial and temporal variability of air temperature. In this paper, we test a simple thermodynamic model proposed by Greuell and Böhm in 1998 as an alternative, using a new dataset of air temperature measurements from along the flowline of Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. The unmodified model performs little better than assuming a constant linear lapse rate. When modified to allow the ratio of the boundary layer height to the bulk heat transfer coefficient to vary along the flowline, the model matches measured air temperatures better, and a further reduction of the root-mean-square error is obtained, although there is still considerable scope for improvement. The modified model is shown to perform best under conditions favourable to the development of katabatic winds - few clouds, positive ambient air temperature, limited influence of synoptic or valley winds and a long fetch - but its performance is poor under cloudy conditions.",

The aim was to investigate the perturbation of turbulence close to the ground generated by the interaction of the flow with the ridge. We present an analysis comparing the data measured at the upstream unperturbed station with those at the top of the obstacle. Moments and spectra of velocity components have been calculated for almost steady periods. The topography and roughness change produce a combined effect on the flow acceleration (of the opposite sign) and on the turbulent stresses (of the same sign). Spectra of velocity components measured at the top of the ridge and scaled by unperturbed quantities evidence an increment of energy in the high frequency subrange with respect to the up-stream flow. Moreover, the horizontal velocity components display a shift in turbulence maximum towards higher frequencies. The vertical velocity spectrum exhibits an energy increment at low frequencies with respect to the upstream spectrum.",

The AWSs are placed on the coastal ice shelf in the katabatic wind zone and on the high Antarctic plateau, and they measure shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes using unheated/unventilated Kipp and Zonen (KZ) CM3/CG3 sensors. During three summertime Antarctic experiments, the AWS sensors were directly compared to instruments of a higher standard, the KZ CM11 for shortwave and Eppley PIR for longwave radiation. It was found that the single-domed KZ CM3 is less sensitive to riming than the double-domed KZ CM11. With an accuracy better than 5% for daily averages, the KZ CM3 and CG3 perform better than their specifications. Net shortwave radiation calculated from individual pairs of incoming and reflected fluxes shows large relative errors, and a method is presented to remedy this. Summertime longwave fluxes measured with the KZ CG3 show very good agreement with ventilated Eppley PIR measurements [root-mean-square difference (rmsd) about 1%], but a larger systematic difference is found when comparison is made with unventilated Eppley PIR measurements. Upward extrapolation of snow temperatures suggest that the unventilated Eppley PIR measurements have a systematic offset, but additional measurements are necessary to confirm this. Wintertime riming of the unventilated/unheated KZ CG3 sensor window leads to rejection of 25% - 28% of the LWdown arrow data for the AWS on the ice shelf and the plateau. Replacing these data with parameterized values removes the systematic offset but introduces an uncertainty of 10% - 15%.",

The most probable explanation is that they formed in late Wisconsinan times as deflation hollows, or 'blowouts', when strong katabatic winds flowed southwards from the continental ice margin across the sparsely vegetated, tundra terrain of the Pine Barrens. Wedge structures and cryoturbation phenomena suggest the existence of either permafrost or deep seasonal frost, and imply mean annual air temperatures of between −0.5 °C and −6 °C. When the groundwater table rose in late-glacial times, the hollows became ponds or wetlands. These were utilized as early as 12,000 years ago by palaeoindian and early archaic cultures as hunting camp sites. Today, many of these wetlands are drying up as the regional water table falls in response to increased water usage from agriculture and urbanization. Copyright",

This study explores the feasibility of improving both τ and r<SUB>eff</SUB> retrievals for partly cloudy (PCL) pixels by using available subpixel samples in a visible to near-infrared band, which many satellite sensors offer. Data are provided by high-resolution reflectance (R) observations and cloud property retrievals by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) at horizontal resolutions between 30-960m. For partly cloudy 960-m observations, the clear-sky component of the pixels induces significant underestimations of up to 58% for τ, while overestimations in r<SUB>eff</SUB> can exceed 41%. This yields underestimations in the derived liquid water path and cloud droplet number concentration of up to 68% and 72%, respectively. By means of three different assumptions it is shown that subpixel R observations in the visible to near-infrared band can be used to estimate higher-resolution R for the second band in the retrieval scheme, as well as the subpixel cloud cover. The estimated values compare well to actually observed ASTER results and are used to retrieve cloud properties, which are unbiased by the clear-sky component of PCL pixels. While the presented retrieval approach is only evaluated for marine boundary layer clouds, it is computationally efficient and can be easily applied to observations from different imagers. As an example, the PCL retrieval scheme is applied to data by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, where similar biases for PCL pixels are observed.",

      "abstract": "Function is dynamic and originates at atomic interfaces. Combining the degrees of freedom of molecules with the peculiar properties of 2D quantum materials can create novel functionality. Here, we report the manipulation and ultrafast imaging of a unidirectional gearing motion in molecules on a 2D quantum material. To visualize and disentangle the intertwined structural and electronic dynamics of such a hybrid interface, we record a 'full molecular movie' by imaging the atomic positions, the evolution of the molecular orbital wavefunctions and the modification of electronic states of the substrate. In a multimodal investigation in a single setup, we disentangle dynamics in valence and core electrons of both the molecule and the surface with femtosecond and sub-ångström precision. The ultrafast rotational motion is fueled by the transfer of hot holes into the molecules that results in 'supercharging' of the film. As hot carriers move through the interface, we track a transient modification of the frontier molecular orbitals and observe a chiral symmetry breaking associated with local structural rearrangements. Our calculations show that the 'supercharging' changes the interfacial potential energy landscape and triggers the gearing motion. The experiment offers all-in-one imaging of the electronic, molecular orbital, chemical and structural dynamics during the flow of charge and energy across the hybrid interface. Our approach provides detailed dynamical information on the mechanism underlying surface-adsorbed molecular gears and enables tailoring novel functionalities in hybrid active matter.",

      "abstract": "The Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator (MCARS) presently produces synthetic radiance data from Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model output as if the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing a combination of atmospheric column inclusive of clouds, aerosols, and a variety of gases and land-ocean surface at a specific location. In this paper we use MCARS to study the MODIS Above-Cloud AEROsol retrieval algorithm (MOD06ACAERO). MOD06ACAERO is presently a regional research algorithm able to retrieve aerosol optical thickness over clouds, in particular absorbing biomass-burning aerosols overlying marine boundary layer clouds in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. The algorithm's ability to provide aerosol information in cloudy conditions makes it a valuable source of information for modeling and climate studies in an area where current clear-sky-only operational MODIS aerosol retrievals effectively have a data gap between the months of June and October. We use MCARS for a verification and closure study of the MOD06ACAERO algorithm. The purpose of this study is to develop a set of constraints a model developer might use during assimilation of MOD06ACAERO data. <P />Our simulations indicate that the MOD06ACAERO algorithm performs well for marine boundary layer clouds in the SE Atlantic provided some specific screening rules are observed. For the present study, a combination of five simulated MODIS data granules were used for a dataset of 13.5 million samples with known input conditions. When pixel retrieval uncertainty was less than 30 %, optical thickness of the underlying cloud layer was greater than 4, and scattering angle range within the cloud bow was excluded, MOD06ACAERO retrievals agreed with the underlying ground truth (GEOS-5 cloud and aerosol profiles used to generate the synthetic radiances) with a slope of 0.913, offset of 0.06, and RMSE=0.107. When only near-nadir pixels were considered (view zenith angle within ±20<SUP>∘</SUP>) the agreement with source data further improved (0.977, 0.051, and 0.096 respectively). Algorithm closure was examined using a single case out of the five used for verification. For closure, the MOD06ACAERO code was modified to use GEOS-5 temperature and moisture profiles as an ancillary. Agreement of MOD06ACAERO retrievals with source data for the closure study had a slope of 0.996 with an offset of −0.007 and RMSE of 0.097 at a pixel uncertainty level of less than 40 %, illustrating the benefits of high-quality ancillary atmospheric data for such retrievals.",

It is proposed that pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (py-f.i.m.s.) provides information on the chemical nature of such material, but caution is also suggested in these interpretations. N.m.r. experiments can give information concerning the spatial location of molecular species, and domains with different mobilities can be recognised. The importance of considering coal origins and petrology in discussions of coal structure is emphasized. An empirical perspective of the molecular phase is afforded by solvent-free catalytic hydrogenation. Coal depolymerization by solvated electrons yields products consistent with polymethylene as a major part of the macromolecular network. The relation of these observations to the molecular mass of extracted material is suggested as crucial.",

Especially the latter method provides an easy way of determining T<SUB>1Z</SUB> and T<SUB>1D</SUB> if they are larger than a few seconds. Though the recovery generally consists of a mixture of two exponentials, under certain conditions they can be detected separately and the relaxation times can be obtained from the respective time constants. As this experiment takes relatively little time, this method can well compete with existing pulse experiments. Moreover, this paper also provides an experimental verification of the Provotorov theory, extended to the case of lock-in detection and non-negligible chemical shift.

Exposure characteristics of features designed at 150 nm pitch size: 75 nm dense lines with 1:1 duty ratio, 2D features at 1:1 and 1:2 duty ratios and isolated lines have been studied. Aerial image simulations were compared to the experimental data. Verification of the aerial image model has been accomplished by measurements of exposure windows of 100 nm and 125 nm nested lines. The PXRL aerial image parameter, equivalent penumbra blur, has been determined from the experimental data. Contributions from the synchrotron radiation x-ray source, stepper and the chemically amplified resist to the degradation of the aerial image have been evaluated. Patterning capability of PXRL at 75 nm feature size is compared to projection optics using the optical k1 factor as a common figure of merit. To facilitate the comparison, optical imagin was at pattern sizes currently manufacturable by the mainstream optical tools while the PXRL imaging was at 75 nm pattern size. Requirements for a PXRL system of manufacturing VLSI at 70 nm minimum feature sizes with the critical dimension control better than 10 percent are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "RNA polymerases encounter specific DNA sites at which RNA chain elongation takes place in the absence of enzyme translocation in a process called discontinuous elongation. For RNA polymerase II, at least some of these sequences also provoke transcriptional arrest where renewed RNA polymerization requires elongation factor SII. Recent elongation models suggest the occupancy of a site within RNA polymerase that accommodates nascent RNA during discontinuous elongation. Here we have probed the extent of nascent RNA extruded from RNA polymerase II as it approaches, encounters, and departs an arrest site. Just upstream of an arrest site, 17-19 nucleotides of the RNA 3'-end are protected from exhaustive digestion by exogenous ribonuclease probes. As RNA is elongated to the arrest site, the enzyme does not translocate and the protected RNA becomes correspondingly larger, up to 27 nucleotides in length. After the enzyme passes the arrest site, the protected RNA is again the 18-nucleotide species typical of an elongation-competent complex. These findings identify an extended RNA product groove in arrested RNA polymerase II that is probably identical to that emptied during SII-activated RNA cleavage, a process required for the resumption of elongation. Unlike Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at a terminator, arrested RNA polymerase II does not release its RNA but can reestablish the normal elongation mode downstream of an arrest site. Discontinuous elongation probably represents a structural change that precedes, but may not be sufficient for, arrest by RNA polymerase II.",

      "abstract": "Critical lithographic dimensions are rapidly approaching the sub-50nm regime where there is a concern that image blur due to acid diffusion will impose a practical limit to the resolution of chemically amplified (CA) resists. Although recent EUV and 193- and 157nm immersion interferometric experiments have reportedly resolved line-space arrays with individual dimensions on the order of ∼40nm, smaller nested features are likely to prove problematic. Numerous reports suggest that conventional photoresist performance degrades rapidly at half-pitch dimensions in this range. New approaches to processing and materials development of photoresists will likely be required if the concept of chemical amplification is to be extended to the 32nm node and beyond. In this article we show that through materials choice and proper processing, image blur can be controlled to an extent where dense features below 40nm can routinely be resolved in CA resists. We describe our studies on high-sensitivity resists of differing activation energies and demonstrate the effect of postexposure bake conditions on the ultimate resolution. Most notably, electron-beam exposure of a CA resist that requires no postexpose bake has demonstrated half-pitch resolution down to 30nm with reasonable process latitude. Acid diffusion measurements performed on the same systems using a 193nm top surface-imaging-technique correlate with the observed resolution of the different resists and processing conditions. Additionally, this system has been probed to explore the effect of humidity on the rate of the resist deprotection reactions in order to determine the impact this might have on resolution.",

Resistance donors of genetic loci to increase B. cinerea resistance are widely unknown. Promising traits of resistance are represented by physical features like the thickness and permeability of the grape berry cuticle. Sensor-based phenotyping methods or genetic markers are rare for such traits. In the present study, the simple-to-handle I-sensor was developed. The sensor enables the fast and reliable measurement of electrical impedance of the grape berry cuticles and its epicuticular waxes (CW). Statistical experiments revealed highly significant correlations between relative impedance of CW and the resistance of grapevines to B. cinerea. Thus, the relative impedance Z<SUB>rel</SUB> of CW was identified as the most important phenotypic factor with regard to the prediction of grapevine resistance to B. cinerea. An ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed a R<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>McFadden</SUB> of 0.37 and confirmed the application of Z<SUB>rel</SUB> of CW for the prediction of bunch infection and in this way as novel phenotyping trait.

We look at results achieved to date on simple CNT-based circuits, and we consider the requirements of more complex architectures.

The quantification of emissions to the environment is a key step in this process. This publication describes the derivation of release factors and gives guidance for estimating use rates for quantifying the emissions from the manufacturing and application of adhesives and sealants. Release factors available for coatings and paints are read across to adhesives or sealants based on similarities between these 2 product groups with regard to chemical composition and to processing during manufacturing and application. The granular emission scenarios in these documents are mapped to the broad emission scenarios for adhesives or sealants. According to the mapping, the worst-case release factors for coatings or paints are identified and assigned to the adhesives or sealants scenarios. The resulting 10 specific environmental release categories (SPERCs) for adhesives and sealants are defined by differentiating between solvent and nonsolvent ingredients and between water-borne and solvent-borne or solvent-free products. These cover the vast majority of the production processes and uses and are more realistic than the 5 relevant emission estimation defaults provided in the REACH guidance. They are accompanied with adhesive or sealant consumption rates in the EU and with guidance for estimating conservative substance use rates at a generic level. The approach of combining conservative SPERC release factors with conservative estimates of substance rates is likely to yield emission estimates that tend to overpredict actual releases. Because this qualifies the approach for use in lower-tier environmental exposure assessment, the Association of the European Adhesive &amp; Sealant Industry (FEICA) SPERCs are available in several exposure assessment tools that are used under REACH. Given the limited regional variation in the manufacturing and use processes of adhesives and sealants, the SPERCs may be applicable for emission estimation not only in the EU but also in other regions.

The depth and strength of the down-valley winds decreased with increasing ambient wind speeds but showed relatively little sensitivity to wind directions in the range of 10 ° to 60 ° from the valley axis. An observed inverse linear decrease of drainage depth with wind speed in a 100 m thick layer above the ridgetops was also found in the simulations for parts of the valley but not near the valley mouth. Vertical motions over the valley showed marked patchiness, and implications of this structure on valley flow dynamics are discussed.",

Antarctic ablation areas are characterized by a low solid precipitation flux in combination with strong sublimation, snowdrift erosion and/or melt. The strong interaction between atmospheric circulation and topography plays a decisive role in the precipitation distribution and hence that of ablation areas. Three types of Antarctic ablation areas can be distinguished, all occurring in dry regions: Type 1 is the erosion-driven ablation area, caused by 1-D and/or 2-D divergence in the katabatic wind field at high elevations (2000-3200 m asl). Type 2 is the sublimation-driven ablation area. This type occurs at lower elevations (&lt;2000 m) preferably at the foot of steep topographic barriers, where temperature and wind speed are high and relative humidity low. Type 3 represents the melt-driven ablation area, occurring in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Combinations of types 1/2 and 2/3 are possible. Over the period considered here (1980-2004), no significant trend is found in the total area covered by Antarctic ablation areas, which equals about 2% of the total ice sheet surface (including ice shelves).",

Surface pressures over the ice sheet decrease during the austral autumn period January-April and increase during the austral springtime months September-December. The largest changes are found over the highest portions of the Antarctic ice sheets where seasonal surface pressure changes of up to 20 hPa are common. The outstanding feature of these surface pressure changes is that typically the isallobaric contours closely follow the Antarctic orography during both transition periods, suggesting a strong seasonal diabatic adjustment within the lower troposphere. During austral autumn, the pronounced cooling of the lower atmosphere adjacent to the ice sheets leads to an enhancement of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime and hence the lower branch of the mean meridional circulation over the high southern latitudes. The mass transport provided by these drainage flows is proposed as the mechanism behind the autumn pressure falls. Numerical simulations of the evolution of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime indicate that the radiative cooling of the sloping ice fields and attendant mass transport result in a modification of the temperature and pressure fields in the lower troposphere similar to what is seen during the early austral autumn period.",

These topographic effects can be preserved in ice cores that are collected at non-ice-divide locations. The trajectory of an ice-core site at South Pole is reconstructed using measurements of ice-sheet motion to show that snow was probably deposited at places of different surface slope during the past 1000 years. Recent accumulation rates, derived from shallow firn cores, vary along this trajectory according to surface topography, so that on a relatively steep flank mean annual accumulation is ∼18% smaller than on a nearby topographic depression. These modern accumulation rates are used to reinterpret the cause of accumulation rate variability with time in the long ice-core record as an ice-dynamics effect and not a climate-change signal. The results highlight the importance of conducting ancillary ice-dynamics measurements as part of ice-coring programs so that topographic effects can be deconvolved from potential climate signals.",

The synchronicity was strong (i.e., earlier ice-adjusted light onset leads to earlier bloom and vice versa) in most of the western Antarctic polynyas but weak in a majority of the eastern Antarctic polynyas. The west-east asymmetry is related to sea ice production rate: the formation of many eastern Antarctic polynyas is associated with strong katabatic wind and high sea ice production rate, leading to stronger water column mixing that could damp phytoplankton blooms and weaken the synchronicity.",

      "abstract": "A new technique for the detection of blowing snow events using satellite lidar data is applied to Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations to obtain the spatial and temporal frequency, layer height, and optical depth of blowing snow events over Antarctica for 2007 through 2009. In addition, spatially and temporally collocated multichannel Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are utilized for the detection of two blowing snow events in sunlight. Blowing snow frequency as high as 70% is found to occur in some regions of Antarctica during winter. The spatial distribution of blowing snow closely follows the katabatic wind pattern with the exception of an area in East Antarctica that encompasses the megadune region, where the most persistent and largest area of blowing snow occurs. Layer thickness ranges from the minimum detectable (30 m) to about 1000 m with an average depth of 120 m for all blowing snow events. The layer optical depth estimated from the lidar data ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 with an average of 0.20. A very large, organized blowing snow \"storm\" is tracked over 3 days and is estimated to transport a mass of 6.3 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> kg m<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP> which is comparable to surface-based measurements of mass transport during blowing snow events. Results from the application of the retrieval technique to ICESat data are also presented with a demonstration of the large multiple scattering-induced elevation error that blowing snow layers can cause.",

      "abstract": "Satellite-derived hourly precipitation values over India and neighboring areas are examined during the summer monsoon season of 2004 to determine the observed patterns of diurnal variations. These are compared with the patterns found in the forecasts from the global spectral model in operation at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in India. The observed hourly precipitation shows that maximum amounts are recorded over most areas of India during the afternoon hours, coinciding with the maximum in surface temperature. This pattern is modified in areas where local mesoscale events like katabatic winds or land-sea breezes produce strong convergence patterns and associated convection. The model forecasts weaken the mesoscale effects on precipitation and the convection due to ground heating seems to start in the model 2-3 h before the time it is observed by the satellites. The frequency and amount of precipitation increases with the forecast length but the hour of maximum precipitation remains almost the same. Harmonic analysis of the frequency of observed precipitation shows that the diurnal cycle predominates in both magnitude and the amount of variance explained. The semidiurnal cycle is considerably smaller in magnitude and explains significant variance only over a small area. Other cycles of smaller periodicity are unimportant in the diurnal variation of precipitation. A similar result is also obtained for the model forecasts except that the spatial distributions of amplitude and variance explained are different from that obtained from the observed data. The spatial distribution and values remain almost the same with forecast length.",

      "abstract": "Up to 30 months of near-surface anemograph records have been examined from 13 locations in and near Melbourne, Australia, to determine the wind patterns which existed during prolonged periods of light winds (at least 3 hours at 2 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> or less). A coherent katabatic wind system was found to develop in at least part of the monitored region on approximately 30% of nights. The flow broadly followed the slope of the basin surrounding the city, with a strong flow down the main river valley, and was partly reinforced by a land breeze in bayside areas. Other valleys also acted as channels for these winds. The general tendency of these katabatic winds was to converge towards the central business district and the northern part of Port Phillip Bay adjacent to the city centre. Where winds from different directions interacted, one of the winds dominated or successive replacement occurred causing the wind direction to vary considerably during a period. There were indications that in the presence of low-level stability with a synoptic gradient wind between east and north, the gradient flow may be deflected around the major topographic barrier to the northeast of the city. The existence of such a situation would have major implications in terms of air quality due to the possibility of pollutants being recirculated in conditions when vertical diffusion was very limited.",

Eighteen shallow snow-firn cores were drilled, and surface snow samples were collected every 5km along the traverse. Firn temperatures were measured in boreholes down to 30 m. The cores were analyzed for β radioactivity to obtain snow accumulation-rate data. The surface snow samples were analyzed for δ18O to correlate isotopic values with borehole temperatures. Multiple regression analysis shows a global near-dry-adiabatic lapse rate and a latitudinal lapse rate of 1.05˚C(˚ lat. S)-1, in the Dome C drainage area. Analysis of firn temperatures reveals a super-adiabatic lapse rate along the ice divide between Talos Dome and the Southern Ocean coast, and in some sectors along the ice divide between the Astrolabe Basin and D59. Snow accumulation rates and firn temperatures show warmer temperatures and higher accumulation values close to the ice divides extending from Talos Dome and Dome C to the Southern Ocean. The spatial pattern of data is linked with a katabatic-wind-source basin and moisture-source region.",

      "abstract": "We provide an overview of the evaluation and development of the Active Fires product derived from the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite during the first year of on-orbit data. Results from the initial evaluation of the standard SNPP Active Fires product, generated by the SNPP Interface Data Processing System (IDPS), supported the stabilization of the VIIRS Sensor Data Record (SDR) product. This activity focused in particular on the processing of the dual-gain 4 micron VIIRS M13 radiometric measurements into 750m aggregated data, which are fundamental for active fire detection. Following the VIIRS SDR product's Beta maturity status in April 2012, correlative analysis between VIIRS and near-simultaneous fire detections from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Earth Observing System Aqua satellite confirmed the expected relative detection rates driven primarily by sensor differences. The VIIRS Active Fires Product Development and Validation Team also developed a science code that is based on the latest MODIS Collection 6 algorithm and provides a full spatially explicit fire mask to replace the sparse array output of fire locations from a MODIS Collection 4 equivalent algorithm in the current IDPS product. The Algorithm Development Library (ADL) was used to support the planning for the transition of the science code into IDPS operations in the future. Product evaluation and user outreach was facilitated by a product website that provided end user access to fire data in user-friendly format over North America as well as examples of VIIRS-MODIS comparisons. The VIIRS fire team also developed an experimental product based on 375m VIIRS Imagery band measurements and provided high quality imagery of major fire events in US. By August 2012 the IDPS product achieved Beta maturity, with some known and documented shortfalls related to the processing of incorrect SDR input data and to apparent algorithm deficiencies in select observing and environmental conditions.",

While MAS provided two-dimensional horizontal fields of cloud optical thickness and effective ice particle radius, the SSFR measured spectral irradiance in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range (0.3-1.7 μm). The MAS retrievals, along with vertical profiles from a combined radar/lidar system on board the same aircraft were used to construct three-dimensional cloud fields, which were input into Monte Carlo radiative transfer models. The simulated field of spectral albedo (ratio of reflected upwelling to incident downwelling irradiance) was compared with the SSFR measurements. For two cases, the relative importance of spatial cloud heterogeneities, various approximations of the single scattering parameters, vertical structure, cirrus optical thickness, and ice crystal effective radius was studied.",

      "abstract": "It was recently demonstrated that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) linewidths for stationary biological samples are dictated mainly by magnetic susceptibility gradients, and that phase-altered spinning sideband (PASS) and phase-corrected magic angle turning (PHORMAT) solid-state NMR techniques employing slow and ultra-slow magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies can be used to overcome the static susceptibility broadening to yield high-resolution, spinning sideband (SSB)-free <SUP>1</SUP>H NMR spectra [Magn. Reson. Med. 46 (2001) 213; 47 (2002) 829]. An additional concern is that molecular diffusion in the presence of the susceptibility gradients may limit the minimum useful MAS frequency by broadening the lines and reducing SSB suppression at low spinning frequencies. In this article the performance of PASS, PHORMAT, total sideband suppression (TOSS), and standard MAS techniques were evaluated as a function of spinning frequency. To this end, 300 MHz (7.05 T) <SUP>1</SUP>H NMR spectra were acquired via PASS, TOSS, PHORMAT, and standard MAS NMR techniques for a 230-μm-diameter spherical glass bead pack saturated with water. The resulting strong magnetic susceptibility gradients result in a static linewidth of about 3.7 kHz that is larger than observed for a natural biological sample, constituting a worst-case scenario for examination of susceptibility broadening effects. Results: (I) TOSS produces a distorted centerband and fails in suppressing the SSBs at a spinning rate below ∼1 kHz. (II) Standard MAS requires spinning speeds above a few hundred Hz to separate the centerband from the SSBs. (III) PASS produces nearly SSB-free spectra at spinning speeds as low as 30 Hz, and is only limited by T<SUB>2</SUB>-induced signal losses. (IV) With PHORMAT, a SSB-free isotropic projection is obtained at any spinning rate, even at an ultra-slow spinning rate as slow as 1 Hz. (V) It is found empirically that the width of the isotropic peak is proportional to F<SUP>- x</SUP>, where F is the spinning frequency, and x=2 for MAS, 0.84 for PASS, and 0.5 for PHORMAT.",

This makes it possible to construct seven real invariant combinations which are independent of this choice. Formulae for the reflectances and transmittances for s- and p-polarized light in terms of these invariants are given for the case that both the substrate and the ambient are non-absorbing.

      "abstract": "The Suomi NPP VIIRS imager provides an opportunity to extend the 17+ year EOS MODIS climate data record into the next generation operational era. Similar to MODIS, VIIRS provides visible through IR observations at moderate spatial resolution with a 1330 LT equatorial crossing consistent with the MODIS on the Aqua platform. However, unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks key water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels used for high cloud detection and cloud-top property retrievals. In addition, there is a significant mismatch in the spectral location of the 2.2 μm shortwave-infrared channels used for cloud optical/microphysical retrievals and cloud thermodynamic phase. Given these instrument differences between MODIS EOS and VIIRS S-NPP/JPSS, a merged MODIS-VIIRS cloud record to serve the science community in the coming decades requires different algorithm approaches than those used for MODIS alone. This new approach includes two parallel efforts: (1) Imager-only algorithms with only spectral channels common to VIIRS and MODIS (i.e., eliminate use of MODIS CO2 and NIR/IR water vapor channels). Since the algorithms are run with similar spectral observations, they provide a basis for establishing a continuous cloud data record across the two imagers. (2) Merged imager and sounder measurements (i.e.., MODIS-AIRS, VIIRS-CrIS) in lieu of higher-spatial resolution MODIS absorption channels absent on VIIRS. The MODIS-VIIRS continuity algorithm for cloud optical property retrievals leverages heritage algorithms that produce the existing MODIS cloud mask (MOD35), optical and microphysical properties product (MOD06), and the NOAA AWG Cloud Height Algorithm (ACHA). We discuss our progress towards merging the MODIS observational record with VIIRS in order to generate cloud optical property climate data record continuity across the observing systems. In addition, we summarize efforts to reconcile apparent radiometric biases between analogous imager channels, a critical consideration for obtaining inter-sensor climate data record continuity.",

Recent studies indicate that stem cells show lineage-specific differentiation when cultured on substrates approximating the stiffness profiles of specific tissues. Although tissues are associated with a range of Young's modulus values for bulk rigidity, at the subcellular level, tissues are comprised of heterogeneous distributions of rigidity. Lithographic processes have been widely explored in cell biology for the generation of analytical substrates to probe cellular physicomechanical responses. In this work, it is shown for the first time that that direct-write e-beam exposure can significantly alter the rigidity of elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates and a new class of 2D elastomeric substrates with controlled patterned rigidity ranging from the micrometer to the nanoscale is described. The mechanoresponse of human mesenchymal stem cells to e-beam patterned substrates was subsequently probed in vitro and significant modulation of focal adhesion formation and osteochondral lineage commitment was observed as a function of both feature diameter and rigidity, establishing the groundwork for a new generation of biomimetic material interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Cloud optical properties such as optical thickness along with surface albedo are important inputs for deriving the shortwave radiative effects of clouds from spaceborne remote sensing. Owing to insufficient knowledge about the snow or ice surface in the Arctic, cloud detection and the retrieval products derived from passive remote sensing, such as from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are difficult to obtain with adequate accuracy - especially for low-level thin clouds, which are ubiquitous in the Arctic. This study aims at evaluating the spectral and broadband irradiance calculated from MODIS-derived cloud properties in the Arctic using aircraft measurements collected during the Arctic Radiation-IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE), specifically using the upwelling and downwelling shortwave spectral and broadband irradiance measured by the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) and the BroadBand Radiometer system (BBR). This starts with the derivation of surface albedo from SSFR and BBR, accounting for the heterogeneous surface in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) with aircraft camera imagery, followed by subsequent intercomparisons of irradiance measurements and radiative transfer calculations in the presence of thin clouds. It ends with an attribution of any biases we found to causes, based on the spectral dependence and the variations in the measured and calculated irradiance along the flight track. <P />The spectral surface albedo derived from the airborne radiometers is consistent with prior ground-based and airborne measurements and adequately represents the surface variability for the study region and time period. Somewhat surprisingly, the primary error in MODIS-derived irradiance fields for this study stems from undetected clouds, rather than from the retrieved cloud properties. In our case study, about 27 % of clouds remained undetected, which is attributable to clouds with an optical thickness of less than 0.5. <P />We conclude that passive imagery has the potential to accurately predict shortwave irradiances in the region if the detection of thin clouds is improved. Of at least equal importance, however, is the need for an operational imagery-based surface albedo product for the polar regions that adequately captures its temporal, spatial, and spectral variability to estimate cloud radiative effects from spaceborne remote sensing.",

      "abstract": "The Eurodelta-Trends (EDT) multi-model experiment, aimed at assessing the efficiency of emission mitigation measures in improving air quality in Europe during 1990-2010, was designed to answer a series of questions regarding European pollution trends; i.e. were there significant trends detected by observations? Do the models manage to reproduce observed trends? How close is the agreement between the models and how large are the deviations from observations? In this paper, we address these issues with respect to particulate matter (PM) pollution. An in-depth trend analysis has been performed for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> for the period of 2000-2010, based on results from six chemical transport models and observational data from the EMEP (Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe) monitoring network. Given harmonization of set-up and main input data, the differences in model results should mainly result from differences in the process formulations within the models themselves, and the spread in the model-simulated trends could be regarded as an indicator for modelling uncertainty. <P />The model ensemble simulations indicate overall decreasing trends in PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> from 2000 to 2010, with the total reductions of annual mean concentrations by between 2 and 5 (7 for PM<SUB>10</SUB>) µg m<SUP>−3</SUP> (or between 10 % and 30 %) across most of Europe (by 0.5-2 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP> in Fennoscandia, the north-west of Russia and eastern Europe) during the studied period. Compared to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, relative PM<SUB>10</SUB> trends are weaker due to large inter-annual variability of natural coarse PM within the former. The changes in the concentrations of PM individual components are in general consistent with emission reductions. There is reasonable agreement in PM trends estimated by the individual models, with the inter-model variability below 30 %-40 % over most of Europe, increasing to 50 %-60 % in the northern and eastern parts of the EDT domain. <P />Averaged over measurement sites (26 for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and 13 for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>), the mean ensemble-simulated trends are −0.24 and −0.22 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, which are somewhat weaker than the observed trends of −0.35 and −0.40 µg m<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> respectively, partly due to model underestimation of PM concentrations. The correspondence is better in relative PM<SUB>10</SUB> and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> trends, which are −1.7 % yr<SUP>−1</SUP> and −2.0 % yr<SUP>−1</SUP> from the model ensemble and −2.1 % yr<SUP>−1</SUP> and −2.9 % yr<SUP>−1</SUP> from the observations respectively. The observations identify significant trends (at the 95 % confidence level) for PM<SUB>10</SUB> at 56 % of the sites and for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> at 36 % of the sites, which is somewhat less that the fractions of significant modelled trends. Further, we find somewhat smaller spatial variability of modelled PM trends with respect to the observed ones across Europe and also within individual countries. <P />The strongest decreasing PM trends and the largest number of sites with significant trends are found for the summer season, according to both the model ensemble and observations. The winter PM trends are very weak and mostly insignificant. Important reasons for that are the very modest reductions and even increases in the emissions of primary PM from residential heating in winter. It should be kept in mind that all findings regarding modelled versus observed PM trends are limited to the regions where the sites are located. <P />The analysis reveals considerable variability of the role of the individual aerosols in PM<SUB>10</SUB> trends across European countries. The multi-model simulations, supported by available observations, point to decreases in SO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-2</SUP> concentrations playing an overall dominant role. Also, we see relatively large contributions of the trends of NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> to PM<SUB>10</SUB> decreasing trends in Germany, Denmark, Poland and the Po Valley, while the reductions of primary PM emissions appear to be a dominant factor in bringing down PM<SUB>10</SUB> in France, Norway, Portugal, Greece and parts of the UK and Russia. Further discussions are given with respect to emission uncertainties (including the implications of not accounting for forest fires and natural mineral dust by some of the models) and the effect of inter-annual meteorological variability on the trend analysis.",

As part of the Permafrost Data Gateway project, we have been developing a science gateway to simplify data pipelines for three scientific use cases. We leverage the Clowder data framework, Docker containers, and Kubernetes so that our pipelines are portable to multiple Cloud environments and other similar pipelines. <P />The LandsatTrends effort classifies permafrost region disturbances (thaw slumps, fire scars, and lake changes) using Landsat data, Google Earth Engine, ML models trained using scikit-learn, and a local OpenStack private cluster. The integration of GEE and the local Kubernetes cluster is generic and adaptable to future use cases. <P />The MAPLE use case classifies ice wedge polygons at the Arctic level, leveraging Tensorflow and GPUs. As our local cluster did not have GPUs available, we created a new kind of Clowder tool which uses scp to transfer files to an HPC resource, ssh to run the classification script, with the result uploaded back to Clowder via its Web API. <P />The Arctic Satellite Joint Product (ASJP) pipeline automatically delivers a much smaller version of Arctic Climate Data Records extracted from NASA satellite data in one small convenient NetCDF file. In this pipeline we upload daily satellite data to Clowder and automatically launch the ASJP code using Clowder's building in automatic execution of analysis code to produce a daily ASJP. <P />The implementation of all three pipelines provide common strategies to deal with hybrid cloud resources and large datasets for analysis and classification of remote sensing data. This allows scientific workflows to be run with a minimum of manual steps by users, and allows scientists to share their code with others through an intuitive, easy to use web interface.",

We now report that a group of chlorinated pesticides, including 2,4-dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene, induces a peptide recognition pattern different from those induced by any one of the classical oestrogen receptor ligands. The pesticide-complexed oestrogen receptors recognized peptides reacting with the receptors complexed both with the natural oestrogen 17β-oestradiol and with the synthetic partial antagonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, respectively, indicating that the pesticide-induced conformation shares features with both the 17β-oestradiol- and the 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-induced conformations. The substitution H524A in the ligand binding domain conferred the pesticide-specific peptide recognition pattern and transactivation activity to the oestradiol- and the 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-complexed receptors, indicating that one important determinant of the pesticide-induced conformation is a lack of stabilisation of any one particular receptor conformation by ligand interaction with H524, which is known to interact with both oestradiol and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Thus, peptide binding analyses of oestrogen receptor conformations induced by environmental endocrine disruptors can give novel information about molecular mechanisms of oestrogen action in general.",

      "abstract": "Ice caves are, similar to mountain glaciers, threatened by the warming climate. To better understand the response of perennial ice in caves to a changing climate, we analysed the thermal characteristics of a sag-type ice cave in the Austrian Alps (Hundsalm ice cave), based on long-term temperature measurements for the period 2008-2021. Observations show a warming trend in all parts of the cave as well as a distinct seasonal pattern with two main regimes, i.e. an open (winter) and a closed (summer) period. During the closed period, a persistent stable stratification prevails that largely decouples the cave from the external atmosphere. The open period is characterised by unstable to neutral stratification, which is an effect of convection during episodes when cold air can penetrate into the cave. Criteria to detect corresponding periods are investigated. Vertical temperature profiles also provide hints on corresponding circulation patterns and the spatial temperature variability in the cave. The positive air temperature trend is reflected in a decrease in perennial cave ice, derived from stake measurements. Besides surface melting, we find compelling evidence of basal melting of ice. The observed ablation rates can be well reproduced by applying a modified degree-day model, which, however, is less feasible regarding mass balance. Overall, we conclude that Hundsalm ice cave is highly impacted by regional warming, which will lead to the disappearance of its perennial ice deposits within the next decades.",

The goal of this field-scale study was to identify the effects of different types of soil amendments (raw manure from cows treated with cephapirin and pirlimycin, compost from antibiotic-treated or antibiotic-free cows, or chemical fertilizer only) and crop type (lettuce [Lactuca sativa L.] or radish [Raphanus sativus L.]) on the transport of two antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs; sul1 and ermB) via storm runoff from six naturally occurring storms. Concurrent quantification of sediment and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; Escherichia coli and enterococci) in runoff permitted comparison to traditional agricultural water quality targets that may be driving factors of ARG presence. Storm characteristics (total rainfall volume, storm duration, etc.) significantly influenced FIB concentration (two-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05), although both effects from individual storm events (Kruskal-Wallis, p &lt; 0.05) and vegetative cover influenced sediment levels. Composted and raw manure-amended plots both yielded significantly higher sul1 and ermB levels in runoff for early storms, at least 8 wk following initial planting, relative to fertilizer-only or unamended barren plots. There was no significant difference between sul1 or ermB levels in runoff from plots treated with compost derived from antibiotic-treated versus antibiotic-free dairy cattle. Our findings indicate that agricultural fields receiving manure-derived amendments release higher quantities of these two \"indicator\" ARGs in runoff, particularly during the early stages of the growing season, and that composting did not reduce effects of ARG loading in runoff.Core Ideas Compost and manure soil amendments elevated FIB and ARGs in storm runoff. Composting manure prior to soil amendment did not reduce ARGs in runoff. Antibiotic and antibiotic-free composts had similar quantities of ARGs and FIB. Vegetable type influenced sediment concentrations, but not FIB or ARGs, in runoff. Storm characteristics affected both FIB and ARG levels.",

Also we use the parametrizations of the Mie theory results for local optical properties of clouds such as the single scattering albedo, extinction coefficient, and asymmetry parameter.

EPIC images are captured on a 2Kx2K CCD array that couples with a filter-wheel, enabling consecutive observations in 10 spectral channels ranging from the UV to the near-IR. One important contribution of EPIC is the ability to observe and retrieve key radiative properties of clouds, which are of critical importance for understanding the current climate system and for predicting climate. A suite of algorithms has been developed to generate the standard EPIC Level 2 Cloud Products that include cloud mask (CM), cloud effective pressure/height (CEP/CEH), cloud optical thickness (COT), etc. The EPIC cloud mask algorithm utilizes reflectance and channel ratio-based tests in the UV, VIS, and NIR, while cloud height is inferred from Oxygen A- and B-band observations and cloud optical thickness is retrieved using a single-channel technique (680 nm over land and 780nm over ocean). The most recent version of the EPIC L2 Cloud Products is v03. Compared to earlier versions, the cloud mask is significantly improved, especially over snow/ice covered land and over ocean sunglint areas through the innovative use of Oxygen A-band observations. In addition, the look-up-tables for Oxygen A- and B-band cloud height retrievals are also updated. Assessment show that the v03 cloud mask matches well with the co-located observations from low earth orbit and geostationary orbit satellites. The EPIC cloud products have been used in many applications, including trace gas retrieval correction, surface solar radiation analysis, cloud system study, cloud diurnal cycle analysis etc. In this presentation, future work on further improving the EPIC cloud products will also be discussed.",

The sequence contains three pronounced changes in deuterium isotopic values at ~18 cal ka, ~12 cal ka, and ~8 cal ka. GPR surveys along the climate sequence reveal continuous, conformable dipping isochrones, separated by two unconformities in the isochrone layers, which correlate with the two older deuterium shifts. We interpret these unconformities as discontinuities in the sequence, rather than direct measures of climate change. Ice sheet models and Internal Layer Continuity Index plots suggest that the unconformities represent periods of erosion occurring, as the former ice surface was scoured by katabatic winds in front of mountains at the head of Horseshoe Valley. This study demonstrates the importance of high-resolution GPR surveys for investigating both paleoflow dynamics and interpreting BIA climate records.",

A total of nine measurements was made on 23 September and 5-6 October 1982. The overnight stable air layers (including the isothermal layer) were able to develop up to a height of 200-300 m above the ground. An elevated inversion at a height of 425-530 m was also observed during the evening of 5 October 1982. The wind field was influenced by the local drainage flows (notably the NE, SW katabatic winds and the SE down-valley flows) in the morning at the lower level, and synoptic scale winds above 200 m. Interaction of the persistent NE winds with the ridges bounding the lower Tamar Valley led to the formation of a stagnant layer up to a height of 80 m in the area during the middle of the night of 5-6 October (the Froude number of 1.39 was consistent with this), and facilitated the formation of katabatic winds on the slopes of the Asbestos/Dazzler Ranges, leading to a SW drainage flow along the general direction of West Arm, spreading out across the river, and occasionally reaching the Bell Bay industrial area as a W-WNW flow. Analysis of the 10-m wind further shows that the complexity of the topography of the coastal valley greatly affects both the local and regional winds, which may have profound implications for air pollution in the area.",

      "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a worldwide contaminant that can cause adverse health effects to wildlife and humans. While atmospheric modeling traces the link from emissions to deposition of Hg onto environmental surfaces, large uncertainties arise from our incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes (oxidation pathways, deposition, and re-emission). Atmospheric Hg reactivity is exacerbated in high latitudes and there is still much to be learned from polar regions in terms of atmospheric processes. This paper provides a synthesis of the atmospheric Hg monitoring data available in recent years (2011-2015) in the Arctic and in Antarctica along with a comparison of these observations with numerical simulations using four cutting-edge global models. The cycle of atmospheric Hg in the Arctic and in Antarctica presents both similarities and differences. Coastal sites in the two regions are both influenced by springtime atmospheric Hg depletion events and by summertime snowpack re-emission and oceanic evasion of Hg. The cycle of atmospheric Hg differs between the two regions primarily because of their different geography. While Arctic sites are significantly influenced by northern hemispheric Hg emissions especially in winter, coastal Antarctic sites are significantly influenced by the reactivity observed on the East Antarctic ice sheet due to katabatic winds. Based on the comparison of multi-model simulations with observations, this paper discusses whether the processes that affect atmospheric Hg seasonality and interannual variability are appropriately represented in the models and identifies research gaps in our understanding of the atmospheric Hg cycling in high latitudes.",

A characteristic temperature change is apparent at all the stations, differing between the colder and the warmer seasons. Some inferences are made regarding the cause of observed variations in some elements both seasonally at all stations and between individual locations.

Here, a major source of DFe to surface waters is thought to be vertical resupply from the benthos, which is assumed most prevalent during winter months when katabatic winds drive sea ice formation and convective overturn in coastal polynyas, although the impact of these processes on water-column DFe distributions has not been previously documented. We collected hydrographic data and water-column samples for trace metals analysis in the Terra Nova Bay and Ross Ice Shelf polynyas during April-May 2017 (late austral fall). In the Terra Nova Bay polynya, we observed intense katabatic wind events, and surface mixed layer depths varied from ∼250 to ∼600 m over lateral distances &lt;10 km there vertical mixing was just starting to excavate the dense, iron-rich Shelf Waters, and there was also evidence of DFe inputs at shallower depths in the water column. In the Ross Ice Shelf polynya, wind speeds were lower, mixed layers were &lt;300 m deep, and DFe distributions were similar to previous, late-summer observations, with concentrations elevated near the seafloor. Corresponding measurements of dissolved manganese and zinc, and particulate iron, manganese, and aluminum, suggest that deep DFe maxima and some mid-depth DFe maxima primarily reflect sedimentary inputs, rather than remineralization. Our data and model simulations imply that vertical resupply of DFe in the Ross Sea occurs mainly during mid-late winter, and may be particularly sensitive to changes in the timing and extent of sea ice production.",

      "abstract": "The extent and duration of surface melting on the Antarctic ice shelves and margins of the Antarctic ice sheet are derived from satellite passive-microwave data for 1978-87. The occurrence of surface melting in daily maps of Tb is indicated by a marked increase in microwave brightness temperature (Tb), which is caused by moisture in the near-surface firn. Tb increases of more than 30 deg above the annual-mean Tb are chosen to indicate melting. Most Antarctic surface melting occurs during December and January. The observed melting is correlated with regional air temperatures, but some melt patterns also appear to be related to katabatic-wind effects. The correlations suggest that the surface melting in Antarctica increases about 3.5 × 106 d km2 per degree of summer temperature increase. The surface-melt index (duration times area of melting) calculated for Antarctica is 24 × 106 d km2, averaged over nine summers. The observed inter-annual and regional variability is large. Surface melting was most extensive during the 1982/83 summer (36 × 106 d km2) and least extensive during the 1985/86 summer (15 × 106d km2). The data indicate a decline in surface melting over the 9 years, but meaningful inferences regarding trends in surface melting are precluded by the large inter-annual variability.",

      "abstract": "Coastal polynyas of the Southern Ocean play a central role in the ventilation of the deep ocean and affect the stability of ice shelves. It appears crucial to incorporate them into climate models, but it is unclear how to adequately simulate them. In particular, there is no consensus on the atmospheric forcing resolution needed to appropriately model the sea ice in coastal Antarctica. A high resolution might be required to represent the local winds such as katabatic winds which are key drivers of coastal polynyas. To fill in this gap, we have tested the sensitivity of sea ice and air-sea-ice interactions to the resolution of the atmospheric forcing in a high-resolution ocean-sea ice model. A set of regional atmospheric simulations at horizontal resolutions of 20, 10, and 5 km are performed with an atmospheric regional model and used to force three ocean-sea ice simulations in the Adélie Land sector, East Antarctica. Due to the better representation of topography with a refined grid, the offshore component of coastal winds becomes stronger at increased resolution. The wind intensification is particularly strong down valleys channelizing the katabatic flow, with increase in wind speed ranging between 1 and 3 m/s. Under a higher resolution forcing, polynyas open more frequently and are wider. This fosters the growth rate of sea ice in polynyas, while landfast ice and pack ice are weakly affected. In polynyas, the production of sea ice is increased by up to 30% at 5 km resolution compared to 20 km resolution. Polynyas downstream of the katabatic wind pathway are more affected than the ones driven by easterly winds, highlighting the importance of the local wind conditions. Brine rejection associated with these higher sea ice production rates affects the salinity budget of the ocean and enhances both the volume and density of the dense Shelf Water produced off Adélie Land. These results underpin the need to better account for local coastal winds and polynyas in ocean and climate models.",

      "abstract": "An improved cloud detection algorithm for the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) is presented. This new algorithm is based on a feedforward artificial neural network and uses as input, for each MLS limb scan, a vector consisting of 1710 brightness temperatures provided by MLS observations from 15 different tangent altitudes and up to 13 spectral channels in each of 10 different MLS bands. The model has been trained on global cloud properties reported by Aqua's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In total, the colocated MLS-MODIS data set consists of 162 117 combined scenes sampled on 208 d over 2005-2020. A comparison to the current MLS cloudiness flag used in \"Level 2\" processing reveals a huge improvement in classification performance. For previously unseen data, the algorithm successfully detects &gt; 93 % of profiles affected by clouds, up from ∼ 16 % for the Level 2 flagging. At the same time, false positives reported for actually clear profiles are comparable to the Level 2 results. The classification performance is not dependent on geolocation but slightly decreases over low-cloud-cover regions. The new cloudiness flag is applied to determine average global cloud cover maps over 2015-2019, successfully reproducing the spatial patterns of mid-level to high clouds seen in MODIS data. It is also applied to four example cloud fields to illustrate its reliable performance for different cloud structures with varying degrees of complexity. Training a similar model on MODIS-retrieved cloud top pressure (p<SUB>CT</SUB>) yields reliable predictions with correlation coefficients &gt; 0.82. It is shown that the model can correctly identify &gt; 85 % of profiles with p<SUB>CT</SUB> &lt; 400 hPa. Similar to the cloud classification model, global maps and example cloud fields are provided, which reveal good agreement with MODIS results. The combination of the cloudiness flag and predicted cloud top pressure provides the means to identify MLS profiles in the presence of high-reaching convection.",

Reliable predictions of cell temperature and heat generation are required for the design and thermal management of battery systems. During the normal operation of LIBs, heat sources can be classified into irreversible heat from resistive losses such as ohmic resistance, charge-transfer overpotentials, and mass-transfer limitations; and reversible heat from entropy change . The irreversible heat generation is related to the cell's internal resistance and the applied current. The reversible heat depends on the entropy variation of electrode materials, the state of charge (SoC), and the temperature. An accurate measurement of entropy-variation will not only help to improve the battery operation under optimal thermal conditions but can also be used to diagnose the battery aging since it can reveal crystal structure changes in the electrodes [1, 2].",

Hence, it can be used for time-critical operational services by providing scientific information as input for local policy decisions on air pollution abatement. The main limitation in its current version is that nonlinear chemical processes are not accounted for and only primary pollutants can be addressed. <P />In this paper we provide a technical description of the method and discuss various applications for scientific and policy purposes.",

      "abstract": "The Multi-sensor Cloud Retrieval Simulator (MCRS) produces a \"simulated radiance\" product from any high-resolution general circulation model with interactive aerosol as if a specific sensor such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing a combination of the atmospheric column and land-ocean surface at a specific location. Previously the MCRS code only included contributions from atmosphere and clouds in its radiance calculations and did not incorporate properties of aerosols. In this paper we added a new aerosol properties module to the MCRS code that allows users to insert a mixture of up to 15 different aerosol species in any of 36 vertical layers.<BR /><BR />This new MCRS code is now known as MCARS (Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator). Inclusion of an aerosol module into MCARS not only allows for extensive, tightly controlled testing of various aspects of satellite operational cloud and aerosol properties retrieval algorithms, but also provides a platform for comparing cloud and aerosol models against satellite measurements. This kind of two-way platform can improve the efficacy of model parameterizations of measured satellite radiances, allowing the assessment of model skill consistently with the retrieval algorithm. The MCARS code provides dynamic controls for appearance of cloud and aerosol layers. Thereby detailed quantitative studies of the impacts of various atmospheric components can be controlled.<BR /><BR />In this paper we illustrate the operation of MCARS by deriving simulated radiances from various data field output by the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model. The model aerosol fields are prepared for translation to simulated radiance using the same model subgrid variability parameterizations as are used for cloud and atmospheric properties profiles, namely the ICA technique. After MCARS computes modeled sensor radiances equivalent to their observed counterparts, these radiances are presented as input to operational remote-sensing algorithms.<BR /><BR />Specifically, the MCARS-computed radiances are input into the processing chain used to produce the MODIS Data Collection 6 aerosol product (M{O/Y}D04). The M{O/Y}D04 product is of course normally produced from M{O/Y}D021KM MODIS Level-1B radiance product directly acquired by the MODIS instrument. MCARS matches the format and metadata of a M{O/Y}D021KM product. The resulting MCARS output can be directly provided to MODAPS (MODIS Adaptive Processing System) as input to various operational atmospheric retrieval algorithms. Thus the operational algorithms can be tested directly without needing to make any software changes to accommodate an alternative input source.<BR /><BR />We show direct application of this synthetic product in analysis of the performance of the MOD04 operational algorithm. We use biomass-burning case studies over Amazonia employed in a recent Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE)-sponsored study of aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction (Freitas et al., 2015). We demonstrate that a known low bias in retrieved MODIS aerosol optical depth appears to be due to a disconnect between actual column relative humidity and the value assumed by the MODIS aerosol product.",

At high laser excitation the electric field separates the laser excited carriers and the change in absorption is attributed to a compensation of the many-particle interaction by the external electrical field. A restoring of the oscillator strength is observed and explained by screening effects of the polarization fields in the interface region due to the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.",

Two new DNP probes were designed for electromagnets operating at a field of 1.4 T. In one probe, DNP can be combined with CPMAS. Compared to a similar probe reported previously, the main advantage of the new probe is the capability to spin vacuum-sealed samples with an improved filling factor. A second probe is based on an oversize microwave cavity. In this probe, large DNP enhancement factors can be obtained in nonlossy samples, e.g., a <SUP>1</SUP>H enhancement factor of 260 for doped polystyrene.",

The method is closely related to the coupled cluster method, but of much easier use. Its efficiency is illustrated on a series of calculations on one-dimensional systems, one of them exhibiting a phase transition.",

      "abstract": "Intensely studied regions as the Alps allow interdisciplinary approaches for better understanding complex structure of the lithosphere in orogens. For this reason a geophysical 3D-density model of the Eastern Alps has been reworked from the petrological perspective. By modeling the metamorphic density of rocks using the Theriak-Domino software package the influence of temperature, pressure and chemical composition on the density has been analysed. Density-isopleth-plots of orthogneisses, metabasites, ultramafics and metapelites, which are typical rocks of the Tauern Window, have been calculated showing characteristic density trends for each rock type, depending on stable mineralogical phases and changes of reactions influenced by the chemical composition. To further investigation the influence of the chemical composition on rock densities various Zentralgneiss samples were analysed. Chemical compositions of 45 Zentralgneiss samples from literature were used in addition to five reworked and newly measured samples. By the usage of the corresponding thin sections, information on the metamorphic grade, weathering state and water content were gained. For the used temperature and pressure conditions a complex relation between the density and composition was observed, depending mainly on an increasing iron content. Based on the petrological findings a geophysical density model has been reinvestigated using the IGMAS+ software. With respect to the results of the TRANSALP working group and information about the Moho depth, a good correlation between the measured and modeled gravity field was reached in the new petrological 3D-density model. This model has been used to further analyse the impact of the Zentralgneiss unit on the short waves of the modeled gravity field, resulting in a shifting to a lower gravity anomaly of -15 % and +8 % for the calculated maximum and minimum density. In this study we emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to enable good established density models for gravity modeling and lithosphere analyses.",

      "abstract": "Floristic and structural data of oak dune forests in western Jutland (Kaergård and Blåbjerg) were collected in 1998 and compared with previous studies of Danish oligotrophic oak forests. A hierarchical divisive clustering resulted in four main clusters, containing two coastal oak vegetation types, Quercus robur– Carex arenaria and Q. robur– Pleurozium schreberi communities, both restricted to the oak dune forest areas in western Jutland, and two more widespread oak forest types, Q. robur– Vaccinium myrtillus and Q. robur– Holcus mollis communities. The low-growing Q. robur– C. arenaria shrub and forest vegetation occurs primarily in the outer dunes, with the tallest trees on the leeward sides of the dunes, while a Q. robur– P. schreberi community is found in the inner parts of the dune system. The similarity to a considerable number of the acidophilous vascular plant species closely relates the Danish oak dune forest communities to the Pinus sylvestris or P. sylvestris– Q. robur vegetation described in neighbouring countries, suggesting that P. sylvestris probably had a prominent role in the Danish oak dune forests before human exploitation caused its extinction in the 18th century. The low-growing oak shrub in the outer dunes, aged between 52 and 85 years, generally seems to have remained unchanged in floristic composition and structure since 1964 when the previous study on the shrub was performed. In the dune valleys, oak stand-level dieback is widespread and was latest recorded in 1985. Such retrogressive processes are probably due to a combination of low winter temperatures and other adverse climatic conditions. In the central parts of the oak dune forest, the oak trees, aged between 55 and 73 years, grow to a higher stature, but also here stand-level dieback is widespread leading to retrogression. Only in the innermost parts, a regular forest cover seems to prevail with trees of 68–104 years of age and the development of the field vegetation cover progresses into a typical forest community. This is exemplified by the decrease of light-demanding species and the establishment of true forest species like Oxalis acetosella and Dryopteris dilatata. The structure and poor-species diversity make the oak dune forest unique both in Denmark and on an international scale. We recommend further studies of the remnants of the original, and in the past probably more widespread dune forests in Denmark, and drawing up of a detailed management and conservation plan. The possibility of permitting the native and now reintroduced P. sylvestris to re-colonise the oak dune forest area and be part of the natural vegetation succession processes should be seriously considered.",

Cross-sections of petioles showed PTORK-driven signals predominantly in the xylem parenchyma surrounding the vessels and in the phloem. Antibodies raised against a unique N-terminal region of PTORK in histo-immunochemical analyses recognised this K<SUP>+</SUP>-release channel in growth-active poplar plants only. PTORK labelling was found in differentiating xylem cells (young fibres) and mature xylem (vessel-associated cells of the ray parenchyma). Patch-clamp measurements on fibre cell protoplasts, derived from young poplar twigs, identified outward-rectifying K<SUP>+</SUP> channels as the major K<SUP>+</SUP> conductance of this cell type, which resembled the biophysical properties of PTORK when expressed in Xenopus oocytes.",

In order to obtain reliable energies for such reactions, sufficiently large basis sets need to be employed. In this paper, we have used high-precision multiwavelet calculations to compute the metal-ligand association energies for 27 transition metal complexes with common ligands, such as H<SUB>2</SUB>, CO, olefins, and solvent molecules. By comparing our multiwavelet results to a variety of frequently used Gaussian-type basis sets, we show that counterpoise corrections, which are widely employed to correct for basis set superposition errors, often lead to underbinding. Additionally, counterpoise corrections are difficult to employ when the association step also involves a chemical transformation. Multiwavelets, which can be conveniently applied to all types of reactions, provide a promising alternative for computing electronic interaction energies free from any basis set errors.",

By inserting these parameters in the S.R.S.D. relaxation equations good agreement between theory and experiment was achieved.

A Delphi study using online questionnaires was conducted from October 2010 to March 2011. One hundred and two insurance physicians reached a consensus on important factors for return to work (RTW) of employees on long-term sick leave; from those factors, the most relevant for the assessment of work ability was determined. From a total of 22 relevant factors considered for the return to work of long-term sick-listed employees, consensus was reached on nine relevant factors that need to be taken into account in the assessment of the work ability of employees on long-term sick leave. Relevant factors that support return to work are motivation, attitude towards RTW, assessment of cognitions and behaviour, vocational rehabilitation in an early stage and instruction for the sick-listed employee to cope with his disabilities. Relevant factors that hinder RTW are secondary gain from illness, negative perceptions of illness, inefficient coping style and incorrect advice of treating physicians regarding RTW. Non-medical personal and environmental factors may either hinder or promote RTW and must be considered in the assessment of the work ability of long-term sick-listed employees. Assessment of work ability should start early during the sick leave period. These factors may be used by IPs to improve the quality of the assessment of the work ability of employees on long-term sick leave.",

      "abstract": "Output of a regional atmospheric climate model is used to quantify the average January and July momentum budget of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over the East Antarctic ice sheet and the surrounding oceans. Results are binned in nine elevation intervals over the ice sheet and six distance intervals over the ocean. In January, when surface cooling is weak, the large-scale pressure gradient force dominates the ABL momentum budget. In July, under conditions of strong surface cooling, a shallow katabatic jet develops over the gentle slopes of the interior ice sheet and a strong, deep jet over the steep coastal slopes. In the coastal regions the ABL thickens considerably, caused by the piling up of cold air over the adjacent sea ice and ice shelves. This represents the main opposing force for the katabatic winds. Horizontal and vertical advection are generally small. In the cross-slope direction the momentum budget represents a simple balance between surface drag and Coriolis turning. Intraseasonal variability of the large-scale wind field in the ABL can be explained in terms of the strength of the polar vortex, the background baroclinicity, and the topography of the ice sheet. Subsidence is found over the interior ice sheet and rising motion in the coastal zone, reflecting the acceleration and deceleration of the katabatic circulation. However, vertical velocities are generally small, because the downslope mass flux in the ABL is confined to a shallow layer below the wind speed maximum.",

In this study a SWE that occurred at Mawson, East Antarctica, involving a hurricane force wind speed of ∼39 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP> is simulated by the Met Office Unified Model at high horizontal resolutions with grid lengths between 12 and 1.5 km. It is shown that all the simulations capture the qualitative evolution of the SWE but underestimate its peak wind speed. The extent of the underestimate is dependent on horizontal resolution, with the 4 and 1.5 km (12 km) models underforecasting the peak wind speed by around 15% (36%). In addition to a strengthening of the katabatic flow, the simulated low-level cyclonic winds associated with the depression responsible for the SWE caused the formation of a barrier-type jet parallel to the coast, resulting in strong wind convergence/interaction at the coastline and suggesting a strong topographic influence on the dynamics responsible for SWE formation. Moreover, it suggests that Mawson is influenced by small-scale gravity waves that formed in response to the stronger winds, and that representation of this was particularly sensitive to horizontal resolution. Additional experiments suggest that the Met Office Unified Model simulation of the SWE is most sensitive to the representation of turbulent mixing under stable conditions. This study is important to identify shortcomings in the performance of the Met Office Unified Model near Antarctica's coastal regions as well as to improve understanding of the processes responsible for SWEs.",

With hurricane force winds, frigid temperatures, and the potential to alter the global thermohaline circulation, the Terra Nova Bay region of Antarctica in the western Ross Sea is an environment where acquiring observations of local atmospheric and oceanic interactions is critical and also extremely challenging. An important feature of Terra Nova Bay is a recurring polynya—an area of nearly ice-free water surrounded by sea ice and land. Strong katabatic winds (cold, negatively buoyant air that flows downslope under the influence of gravity) drain from the interior of the continent and blow over the open water of the polynya, resulting in large upward fluxes of heat and moisture. Sea ice production occurs as a result of the large transfer of heat from sea to air, with the newly formed sea ice blown offshore, effectively removing freshwater from the coastal ocean. The high-salinity water created through this process becomes part of the global thermohaline circulation as Antarctic bottom water. Coastal polynyas, such as the one in Terra Nova Bay, are of interest to atmospheric scientists and oceanographers due to the intense air-sea coupling and the impact of these fluxes on the state of the atmosphere and ocean.",

Moreover, the altimeter is also a radar which makes it possible to estimate the snow surface or subsurface characteristics, such as surface roughness induced by the strong katabatic wind or ice grain size. The polar ice caps may not be in a stationary state, they continue to respond to the climatic warming of the beginning of the Holocene, that is 18000 years ago, and possibly start to react to present climatic warming: the altimeter offers the unique means of estimating the variations of volume and thus the contribution of polar ice caps to present sea level change.",

The origin of the loess material in the southern Pannonian Basin (Vojvodina), the lower Danube Basin/Dobrudja and the Dnieper area was evaluated by comparison with the representative element composition of possible source areas and by considering the geomorphodynamic setting. Also the background values of the initial magnetic susceptibility of the loesses were taken into account. For the lower Danube Basin, Dobrudja and the Ukraine, paleowind direction was reconstructed based on the geographic distribution of sandy soil texture and dunes related to river systems. Finally, loesses were evaluated as possible samples of the average upper continental crust. Our results show that Danube and Dnieper loess areas can be clearly distinguished. The former reveal higher Al and Fe contents, the latter higher Si, Zr, Hf content and indications of effective mineral and grain size sorting. We can confirm that Vojvodina loess originated from Danube alluvial material and loess of the Dnieper area from glaciofluvial sediments of the Fennoscandinavian ice sheet. The Dobrudja loess derived also predominantly from Danube alluvium, but shows significant contribution of a second loess source, probably the glaciofluvial sediments of the Ukraine. This was forced by northerly katabatic winds from the Fennoscandinavian ice sheet, whereas WNW winds prevailed in the Western Walachian plain. The studied loesses reflect the average composition of the upper continental crust. Yet, biases exist due to selective mineral/element enrichment and depletion in the course of previous sedimentary recycling phases, respectively. Material of all studied loess deposits seems to derive originally from sedimentary rocks.",

During glacial times, the occurrence of polynyas proximal to expansive ice sheets in both hemispheres has been proposed to explain limited ocean ventilation and a habitat requirement for marine and higher-trophic terrestrial fauna. Nonetheless, their existence remains equivocal, not least due to the hitherto paucity of sufficiently characteristic proxy data. Here we demonstrate polynya formation in front of the NW Eurasian ice sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which resulted from katabatic winds blowing seaward of the ice shelves and upwelling of warm, sub-surface Atlantic water. These polynyas sustained ice-sheet build-up, ocean ventilation, and marine productivity in an otherwise glacial Arctic desert. Following the catastrophic meltwater discharge from the collapsing ice sheets at 17.5 ka BP, polynya formation ceased, marine productivity declined dramatically, and sea ice expanded rapidly to cover the entire Nordic Seas.",

Results obtained from sediment sample analysis suggest activity and passive movement of a rock glacier-like landform, albeit minimal. Wind seems to play an important role in Patriot Hills local geomorphology. Periglacial features such as slightly creeping debris-mantled slope appear to have preferred slope orientation.

      "abstract": "Sea-ice extent is very sensitive to climate change and its minor variations can significantly affect the regional biota of the Southern Ocean (SO). Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) is a primary proxy for the understanding of phytoplankton distribution and primary productivity in the oceans. Therefore, analysing the relation between Chl-a and sea-ice extent could be significant in understanding the role of SO sea-ice extent on regional Chl-a variability. Local Chl-a variability in the SO was analysed in five major sectors, utilizing 39 years of remotely sensed sea ice and 15 years of Chl-a and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets. Katabatic winds blowing offshore from the Antarctic coast were found to enhance the sea-ice extent during winter and diminish sea-ice melting in the austral summer in the SO. Thus, cold polar wind enhanced the sea-ice extent whereas warm subtropical winds reduced its formation. The Weddell Sea region showed the highest monthly averaged sea-ice extent of 6.2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>km<SUP>2</SUP> during September (austral spring), whereas monthly averaged sea-ice extent was less than 2.9 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>km<SUP>2</SUP> for any other region. The largest sea-ice extent of 2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP>km<SUP>2</SUP> was observed in the Ross Sea during the austral summer (December, January, and February) owing to the katabatic winds. All other regions reported sea-ice extents below 1.15 × 10<SUP>4</SUP>km<SUP>2</SUP>. Melting of sea ice during the austral summer was responsible for enhanced Chl-a in the SO through increased availability of nutrients in the near surface waters. Considering Chl-a as a proxy for productivity in the SO, the western sector (Weddell, Bellam and Ross Sea regions) was found to be more productive than the eastern sector (Indian and Pacific Ocean regions) during the study period. To understand the vertical variation of physical and biogeochemical variables and their influence on Chl-a variability, data from a few active Biogeochemical-Argo floats in the region were analysed. It was concluded that while the surface Chl-a was directly influenced by SST variations and sea-ice melting, the nutricline influenced the depth of Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) and Chl-a vertical distribution in the SO.",

      "abstract": "In order to characterize the Antarctic aerosol and to analyze the effect of katabatic winds on the properties of suspended particles, measurements of solar direct and diffuse irradiance were carried out at the Italian Terra Nova Bay station in Antarctica, during the 2001-2002 austral summer campaign. Measurements were performed by the ground-based PREDE sky radiometer and processed by using the Skyrad inversion code. Aerosol optical thickness at 500 nm was found to vary between 0.01 and 0.02. The volume size distribution curves showed bimodal features with the two modes located within 0.1-0.3 μm and 5-7 μm radius intervals, respectively. The real part of the refractive index characterizing the Antarctic aerosol was found to have a mean value of 1.40. During the katabatic event the analysis indicated that the advection of larger and drier fresh particles, together with the removal of marine suspended particles, caused the decrease in aerosol optical thickness.",

This simulation is compared with a revised estimate of annual accumulation rate distribution over Greenland taking into account information from a new set of ice core analyses, based on surface sample collections from the North Greenland Traverse. The region with accumulation rates below 150 mm yr<SUP>1</SUP> in central-northwest Greenland is much larger than previously assumed and extends about 500 km farther to the south. It is demonstrated that good agreement between modeled and observed regional precipitation and accumulation patterns exists, particularly concerning the location and the values of very low accumulation in the middle of Greenland. The accumulation rates in the northern part of Greenland are reduced in comparison to previous estimates. These minima are connected with a prevailing blocking high over the Greenland ice sheet and katabatic wind systems preventing humidity transports to central Greenland. The model reasonably represents the synoptic situations that lead to precipitation. Maxima of precipitation and accumulation occur at the southwestern and southeastern coasts of Greenland and are connected with cyclonic activity and the main storm tracks around Greenland. The central region of the Greenland ice sheet acts as a blocking barrier on moving weather systems and prohibits cyclones moving from west to east across this region and, thus prevents moisture transports.",

      "abstract": "The mass balance of the drainage area of Ice Stream B, West Antarctica, is calculated from new measurements of both discharge and accumulation rate. The discharge is computed for a transverse section near the lower end of the ice stream. Velocities have been obtained for 787 sites, using repeated photogrammetry, with ground control by Transit (doppler) satellite tracking. Thicknesses have been obtained by radio echo-sounding. The uncertainties in the discharge calculations are only about 3%. Net accumulation is derived from profiles of gross beta activity and from identification of the 1954-55 and 1964-65 nuclear-bomb strata. The major uncertainties are associated with the identification of the catchment area and with the accumulation rate. Accumulation rate varies locally, probably due to the interaction of katabatic wind with local slope, and many spot measurements are needed to obtain a good regional mean. The integrated input is 21.4 ± 5.2 km3a−1, and the output is 30.0 ± 1.0 km3a−1. The deficit is thus 8.6 ± 6.2 km3a−1, which corresponds to a mean thinning rate of 0.06 m a−1± 0.04 m a−1. The difference from earlier estimates is mainly due to the refined catchment area and accumulation. The imbalance is significant but smaller than previously calculated: for balance the accumulation rate or catchment area would need to be about 39% larger or the ice stream velocity would need to be 28% slower.",

Reanalysis/analysis fields are used to examine the synoptic background in which such events take place. SWEs are a feature of the extended winter season and involve a complex interaction between the downslope buoyancy forcing and the pressure gradient force from synoptic-scale cyclones. Around the coast of East Antarctica the significant majority of SWEs are associated with enhancement of the downslope katabatic flow by the broadscale synoptic circulation, involving a deepening of pressure off the coast and an increase of pressure inland. Orientation of the valleys in relation to the cyclone track is critical in enabling enhancement of the katabatic winds. Casey, Mawson, and Dumont d'Urville stations report the greatest number of winds of storm force and stronger. Interannual variability of SWE numbers is large. Trends in the number of winter strong wind reports are small. The greatest statistically significant increase in wind speed since the 1950s has been at Faraday/Vernadsky and Syowa stations. The largest wind speed increases since 1979 have been at Davis and Mawson stations. Comparison with high-resolution numerical simulations showed that the reanalysis/analysis fields are able to capture the large-scale synoptic features and the associated enhancement of the katabatic flow but underestimated the observed wind speed if it was strongly influenced by local topographical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Landscapes derived solely from aeolian processes are rare on Earth because of the dominance of subaqueous processes. In contrast, aeolian-derived landscapes should typify Mars because of the absence of liquid water, the long exposure times of surfaces, and the presence of wind as the default geomorphic agent. Using the full range of available orbital and Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity images, wind-formed features in Gale Crater were cataloged and analyzed in order to characterize the aeolian landscape and to derive the evolution of the crater wind regime over time. Inferred wind directions show a dominance of regional northerly winds over geologic time-scales, but a dominance of topography-driven katabatic winds in modern times. Landscapes in Gale Crater show a preponderance of aeolian features at all spatial scales. Interpreted processes forming these features include first-cycle aeolian abrasion of bedrock, pervasive deflation, organization of available sand into bedforms, abundant cratering, and gravity-driven wasting, all of which occur over a background of slow physical weathering. The observed landscapes are proposed to represent a spectrum of progressive surface denudation from fractured bedrock, to retreating bedrock-capped mesas, to remnant hills capped by bedrock rubble, to desert pavement plains. This model of landscape evolution provides the mechanism by which northerly winds acting over ∼3 Ga excavated tens of thousands of cubic kilometers of material from the once sediment-filled crater, thus carving the intra-crater moat and exhuming Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mons). The current crater surface is relatively sand-starved, indicating that potential sediment deflation from the crater is greater than sediment production, and that most exhumation of Mount Sharp occurred in the ancient geologic past.",

This event demonstrated the rapid establishment of extreme Antarctic sea ice conditions on synoptic time scales. The event was associated with cyclones that developed at lower latitudes. Near the event site, cyclone-enhanced strong southeasterly katabatic winds drove large westward drifts of ice floes. In addition, the cyclones also gave southward ice drift. The arrival and grounding of Iceberg B9B in Commonwealth Bay in March 2011 led to the growth of fast ice around it, forming a northward protruding barrier. This barrier blocked the westward ice drift and hence aided sea ice consolidation on its eastern side. Similar cyclone-induced events have occurred at this site in the past after the grounding of Iceberg B9B. Future events may be predictable on synoptic time scales, if cyclone-induced strong wind events can be predicted.",

Summer temperatures stay below 0°C, which implies that no melt takes place. Because the AWS is located on a dome, katabatic winds are not active, the wind direction is variable (directional constancy 0.38) and the wind speed relatively low (4.5 ms−1). Annual average variables are compared with data from Recovery Glacier AWS and Halley station.The measurements are used to evaluate the surface energy fluxes for the 3 year period by using a surface energy-balance model. The annual average gain of energy from the sensible-heat flux ( + 10.8 W m-2) is balanced by a negative net radiative flux (-9.1 W m−2) and a small negative latent-heat flux (-1.7 W rrT2).

The Antarctic surface wind climate can be classified based on the Weibull shape factor k <SUB> w </SUB>. Very high values ( k <SUB> w </SUB> &gt; 3) are found in the interior plateaus, typical of very uniform katabatic-dominated winds with high directional constancy. In the coast and all over the Antarctic Peninsula the shape factors are similar to the ones found in mid-latitudes ( k <SUB> w </SUB> &lt; 3) typical of synoptically dominated wind climates. The Weibull shape parameter is systematically overpredicted by ERA reanalyses. This is partly corrected by RACMO2/ANT simulations which introduce more wind speed variability in complex terrain areas. A significant improvement is observed in the performance of ERA-Interim over ERA-40, with an overall decrease of 14 % in normalized mean absolute error. In escarpment and coastal areas, where the terrain gets rugged and katabatic winds are further intensified in confluence zones, ERA-Interim bias can be as high as 10 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. These large deviations are partly corrected by the regional climate model. Given that RACMO2/ANT is an independent simulation of the near-surface wind speed climate, as it is not driven by observations, it compares very well to the ERA-Interim and AWS-115 datasets.",

      "abstract": "Mass and energy balance of ice sheets are driven by complex interactions between the atmosphere and the cryosphere. Feedbacks between katabatic winds and the cryosphere may lead to the formation of sedimentation waves, so-called megadunes, at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, and spectroscopic data acquired by Mars orbiters. We show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves have similarities with Antarctic ice megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Their shallow-dipping upwind sides, their tops and the intervening troughs are covered by young ice and occasional sastrugi fields, indicative of net accumulation. On the other hand, their steep-dipping downwind sides either expose exhumed layers of dusty old ice or correspond to smooth surfaces of coarse-grained ice, indicative of net ablation or reduced net accumulation associated with sublimation and metamorphism. These surface characteristics and the internal stratigraphic architecture revealed by radar sounding are consistent with the interpretation that both sets of Martian sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. The smaller waves, characterized by reduced net accumulation on their downwind sides, are probably analogous to the Antarctic megadunes that have been described so far. On the other hand, a terrestrial equivalent remains to be discovered for the larger ones, characterized by net ablation on their downwind sides. The recognition of these sedimentation waves provides the basis for the development of a common model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of Martian and terrestrial ice sheets and for future investigations on the respective roles of wind-driven particle transport, heat and mass transfer of water vapor, ice metamorphism and glacial flow of ice sheets.",

Although the glacierised area is substantial for affecting summer flows in these basins, there are no measurements or quantified estimates of glacier runoff contribution. In an effort to provide an estimate of glacier runoff for the region, we measured ablation over 5 years, set up weather stations and temperature sensors in Summers 2009 and 2010 and developed a melt model for Shackleton Glacier (42.5 km2), the largest outlet of the Clemenceau Icefield Group (271 km2), which is the major local ice mass feeding into the Upper Columbia basin. Two HOBO weather stations (WS) were installed on the glacier for two weeks in Summer 2010, one near the left lateral moraine on very dirty ice, and one mid-glacier on relatively clean ice. Instrumentation included pyranometers (solar radiation and albedo), and temperature, wind speed and direction, relative humidity and barometric pressure sensors. A weather station off ice provided additional temperature and precipitation data. Other data included daily ablation stake measurements, surface roughness measurements, temperature data from Tidbit loggers on and off ice, and daily manual weather observations. Yearly ablation stake measurements and summer weather observations have been made by our team since 2005. A BC River Forecast Centre automatic snow pillow station provides additional temperature and precipitation data. Using these meteorological and ablation data for parameterisation and optimisation, a distributed GIS melt model was constructed from a simple energy balance model. The model is driven by hourly direct and diffuse radiation and DEM hillshading, an albedo parameterisation based on four ice/snow zones identified from a satellite image and field measurements, constant daily values of longwave radiation as a function of percent cloud cover, and sensible heat input as a function of air temperature, katabatic wind, surface roughness and elevation. Latent heat was considered negligible. Novel aspects of the melt model include a valley temperature threshold for katabatic wind (using on and off ice temperatures and katabatic wind speed) and slope corrected area melt and radiation calculations. In an attempt to quantify energy balance effects of tributary-trunk detachment due to glacier recession related glacier fragmentation, special attention was paid to the potential influence from lateral moraines and valley walls and very dirty ice on the ablation in ice marginal regions. Observations suggest that, when katabatic wind diminishes, heat advection from an even moderately warmer lateral moraine can raise nearby glacier temperature substantially. This suggests that a combination of katabatic wind fields and proximity to lateral moraines/rock walls may be important in calculations of sensible heat contribution to surface melt in recently fragmented glacier systems.",

Environmental contours offer descriptions of extreme environmental conditions commonly applied for reliability analysis in the early design phase of marine structures. Usually, they are applied in order to reduce the number of computationally expensive response analyses needed for reliability estimation. We solve this problem by reformulating it as a linear programming problem. Rigorous convergence analysis is performed, both in terms of convergence of mean widths and in the sense of the Hausdorff metric.

      "abstract": "We study matrix sensing, which is the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. It can be formulated as an overparameterized regression problem, which can be solved by factorized gradient descent when starting from a small random initialization. Linear neural networks, and in particular matrix sensing by factorized gradient descent, serve as prototypical models of non-convex problems in modern machine learning, where complex phenomena can be disentangled and studied in detail. Much research has been devoted to studying special cases of asymmetric matrix sensing, such as asymmetric matrix factorization and symmetric positive semi-definite matrix sensing. Our key contribution is introducing a continuous differential equation that we call the $\\textit{perturbed gradient flow}$. We prove that the perturbed gradient flow converges quickly to the true target matrix whenever the perturbation is sufficiently bounded. The dynamics of gradient descent for matrix sensing can be reduced to this formulation, yielding a novel proof of asymmetric matrix sensing with factorized gradient descent. Compared to directly analyzing the dynamics of gradient descent, the continuous formulation allows bounding key quantities by considering their derivatives, often simplifying the proofs. We believe the general proof technique may prove useful in other settings as well.",

      "abstract": "Forests in eastern North America receive anthropogenically-elevated nitrogen (N) deposition that alters soil biogeochemistry and forest productivity. To predict N deposition effects on soil carbon (C) cycling, we annually applied N (100 kg·N·ha<SUP>-1</SUP>·y<SUP>-1</SUP>) since 1993 to a productive, N-rich black cherry-sugar maple second-growth forest, with the intention of accelerating responses of the forest to N deposition. After nearly two decades, soil C in O, A, and upper 50cm of B horizons of N-Addition plots (14.2 ± 0.7 kg C·m<SUP>-2</SUP>) was 17% greater than Control plots. Aboveground tree biomass growth and litterfall were not affected by fertilization, and thus did not explain increased soil C. Fine root mass (0-1mm) was 34% greater in N-Addition plots, but additional root C inputs were insufficient to explain total soil C increases. The primary driver of increased soil C is reduced decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. Decomposition rates of aboveground black cherry, sugar maple, and mixed leaf litter were 43, 67, and 36%, greater, respectively, in control than N-Addition plots. N-Addition plots had indicators of reduced organic matter (OM) decomposition; there were higher proportions of less decomposed light-fraction OM than more decomposed heavy-fraction OM, as well as selective preservation of a range of plant-derived compounds (steroids, lignin-derived, cutin- and suberin-derived compounds) that have anti-microbial properties or are non-preferred microbial substrates. Soil biotic activity was reduced, with lower soil respiration and reduced microbial biomass in N-addition plots than controls. The soil microbial community composition was also altered dramatically with N additions. Recalcitrant organic matter enzyme activity (peroxidase) was reduced in the O-horizon by N-Addition. Available Ca, Mg, and K were reduced in O and A horizons by N fertilization. These results suggest that chronic elevated atmospheric N inputs can increase forest soil C storage by decreasing decomposition, however the long-term stability of this additional C sequestration is unknown.",

      "abstract": "Permafrost thaw has been observed at several locations across the pan-Arctic in recent decades, yet the pan-Arctic extent and potential spatial-temporal variations in thaw are poorly constrained. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be inferred and quantified with satellite imagery due to the subsequent differential ground subsidence and erosion that in turn affects land surface cover. Information contained within existing and rapidly growing collections of high-resolution satellite imagery (Big Imagery) is here extracted across the Arctic region through a collaboration between software engineers, computer- and earth scientists. More specifically, we are a) developing geospatial data down to sub-meter resolution, and also b) enabling discovery and knowledge-generation through visualization tools. This cyberinfrastructure platform, the Permafrost Discovery Gateway (PDG), is being designed with input from users of the PDG, e.g. primarily the Arctic earth science community but also the general public. The PDG builds upon other NSF supported data management resources (Arctic Data Center and Clowder) and the Fluid Earth Viewer. The Fluid Earth Viewer, the first visualization tool implemented into the PDG, was initially created for the public to explore atmospheric and oceanographic visualizations in coarse spatial resolution (15km) and is here modified to support permafrost geospatial products, and a number of community built analytic tools to identify permafrost artifacts within satellite imagery. New tools include the ImageryViewer and the PLotViewer, which are aimed for visualization and analysis of big data. The effort also includes workflow optimization of remote sensing code for pan-Arctic sub-meter scale mapping of ice-wedge polygons from optical imagery. We are additionally actively engaging with the user-community to ensure that the PDG becomes useful, both in terms of the type of data contained within the PDG and the design of the visualization tools. The PDG has the potential to fill key Arctic science gaps, such as bridging plot to pan-Arctic scale findings, while also serving as a resource informing decisions regarding the economy, security, and resilience of the Arctic region",

      "abstract": "Housing wealth is the largest component of wealth for a majority of Swedish households. Whereas investments in housing are merely defined by income, the returns on this investment (capital gains) are dependent on local housing market dynamics. Since the 1990s, local housing market dynamics in Swedish cities have been altered by the upswing in levels of socio-spatial inequality. The simultaneous up- and downgrading of neighbourhoods is reflected in house price developments and exacerbates the magnitude of capital gains and losses. This article proposes that the selective redirection of housing pathways that causes an upswing in socio-spatial inequality translates into an uneven distribution of capital gains as well. A sequence analysis of the housing pathways of one Swedish birth cohort (1970-1975), based on population-wide register data (GeoSweden), is used to explain differences in capital gains between different social groups in the period 1995-2010. The results indicate higher capital gains for individuals with higher incomes and lower gains for migrants. When socio-spatial inequality increases, the more resourceful groups can use their economic and cultural capital to navigate through the housing market in a more profitable way.",

In this study, we investigate the response of a Bi<SUB>2</SUB>Sr<SUB>2</SUB>CaCu<SUB>2</SUB>O8+<SUB>δ</SUB> crystal to the charge redistribution induced by an infrared ultrashort pulse. Element-selective time-resolved core-level photoelectron spectroscopy with a high energy resolution allows disentangling the dynamics of oxygen ions with different coordination and bonds thanks to their different chemical shifts. Our experiment shows that the O 1s component arising from the Cu-O planes is significantly perturbed by the infrared light pulse. Conversely, the apical oxygen, also coordinated with Sr ions in the Sr-O planes, remains unaffected. This result highlights the peculiar behavior of the electronic structure of the Cu-O planes. It also unlocks the way to study the out-of-equilibrium electronic structure of copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconductors by identifying the O 1s core-level emission originating from the oxygen ions in the Cu-O planes. This ability could be critical to gain information about the strongly-correlated electron ultrafast dynamical mechanisms in the Cu-O plane in the normal and superconducting phases.",

The peaks in conductance occur when the Fermi energy in the leads is degenerate with one of the quantized energy levels of the artificial atom, thus providing a measure of the chemical potential µ<SUB>N</SUB> of the artificial atom with a fixed number N of electrons. Detailed comparison of µ<SUB>N</SUB> at high magnetic field with theory shows that exchange profoundly affects the ground state of electrons confined in this way.

      "abstract": "The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethylene is a promising alternative for the oil based industry. In this process, beside the valuable product ethylene, unwanted by-products like CO <SUB>2</SUB> are produced. Hence, the gas stream has to be refined further. The process is not applied in the industry yet, because of high separation costs. This article focuses particular on the CO <SUB>2</SUB> purification of the OCM product stream. Therefore a case study was done for a design task of 90% CO <SUB>2</SUB> capture from 25 vol% in the OCM product gas with an operation pressure of 32 × 10 <SUP>5</SUP> Pa. Within the article is shown, how to resolve the lack of high separation cost for the purification and the development of an integrated, energy efficient CO <SUB>2</SUB> capture process for the OCM refinery is described. Therefore a state of the art chemical absorption process using monoethanolamine (MEA) was developed and optimized for the base case. Therefore Aspen Plus <SUP>®</SUP> with the build-in rate based model for the mass transfer with an electrolyte NRTL - approach and chemical equilibrium reactions for the water-MEA-CO <SUB>2</SUB> system as well as kinetic reactions based on the MEA-REA package was applied. In order to improve the energetic process performance, gas permeation with dense membranes was studied as process alternative. For this purpose a membrane unit was developed in Aspen Custom Modeler <SUP>®</SUP> (ACM). The solution-diffusion model with the free-volume-theory for gas permeation including Joule-Thomson effect as well as concentration polarization (Stünkel et al., 2009) was applied successfully. Furthermore several selective materials for a composite membrane with experimentally determined parameters were studied by this model and it was found, that a matrimide membrane provides the best selectivity performance for the OCM CO <SUB>2</SUB> capture. Based on this material a membrane module was installed to form a hybrid separation process in combination with the amine based absorption process. The comparison of the state of the art process with the novel hybrid separation process shows an energy saving of more than 40% for the OCM CO <SUB>2</SUB> capture. In the experimental study the stand alone performance of each unit, as well as the performance of the hybrid process were studied and the results are presented in this article.",

Since June 2015, EPIC has been providing observations of the sunlit side of the Earth with its 10 spectral channels ranging from the UV to the near-infrared. A suite of algorithms has been developed to generate the standard EPIC Level 2 cloud products that include cloud mask, cloud effective pressure/height, and cloud optical thickness. The EPIC cloud mask adopts the threshold method and utilizes multichannel observations and ratios as tests. Cloud effective pressure/height is derived with observations from the O2 A-band (780 and 764 nm) and B-band (680 and 688 nm) pairs. The EPIC cloud optical thickness retrieval adopts a single-channel approach in which the 780 and 680 nm channels are used for retrievals over ocean and over land, respectively. Comparison with co-located cloud retrievals from geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites shows that the EPIC cloud product algorithms are performing well and are consistent with theoretical expectations. These products are publicly available at the Atmospheric Science Data Center at the NASA Langley Research Center for climate studies and for generating other geophysical products that require cloud properties as input.",

While numerous positive resists have been shown to have high-resolution, negative resists were considered to have poor contrast and resolution. In this paper, the electron-beam exposure characteristics of several negative resist systems including epoxy novolac-type systems [K. J. Stewart, M. Hatzakis, J. M. Shaw, and D. E. Seeger, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 7, 1734 (1989); M. Hatzakis, K. Stewart, J. Shaw, and S. Rishton, Microelectron. Eng. 11, 487 (1990)] and two selected vendor resist systems have been investigated. These resist exposure characteristics are related to resist resolution, image profile, edge acuity, and process latitude. The sensitivity of various resists to slight exposures which may be caused by electron scattering in electron-beam lithography or mask diffraction in optical or x-ray lithography varies from resist to resist. The resist system that is least sensitive to these slight exposure effects offers the highest resolution. High-resolution images down to 0.25-μm lines and spaces were delineated only in resist systems with a gamma value higher than 2.5. Resist images of 50 nm dimensions in 0.4-μm-thick resist films have been obtained from the epoxy novolac system with vertical sidewalls and good edge acuity. In addition, results of high-voltage electron-beam exposures showed that residues between small shapes are substantially reduced. Similarly, cleanly resolved features were obtained when a high-contrast mask is used in x-ray synchrotron exposures.",

In a clinical study conducted over a two year period, the dual-energy system proved to be highly successful in improving the detection (p=0.0005) and characterization (p=0.005) of pulmonary nodules when compared to conventional screen-film radiography. The basic components of our dual-energy detector system include source filtration with gadolinium to produce a bi-modal x-ray spectrum and a cassette containing four CR imaging plates. The front and back plates record the low-energy and high-energy images, respectively, and the middle two plates serve as an intermediate filter. Since our initial report, a number of improvements have been made to make the system more practical. An automatic registration algorithm based on image features has been developed to align the front and back image plates. There have been two improvements in scatter correction: a simple correction is now made to account for scatter within the multi-plate detector; and a correction algorithm is applied to account for scatter variations between patients. An improved basis material decomposition (BMD) algorithm has been developed to facilitate automatic operation of the algorithm. Finally, two new noise suppression techniques are under investigation: one adjusts the noise filtering parameters depending on the strength of edge signals in the detected image in order to greatly reduce quantum mottle while minimizing the introduction of artifacts; a second routine uses knowledge of the region of valid low-energy and high-energy image data to suppress noise with minimal introduction of artifacts. This paper is a synthesis of recent work aimed at improving the performance of dual-energy CR conducted at three institutions: Philips Medical Systems, the University of Wisconsin, and Duke University.",

      "abstract": "The Suomi NPP and JPSS series VIIRS imagers provide an opportunity to extend the NASA EOS Terra (20+ year) and Aqua (18+ year) MODIS cloud climate data record into the new generation NOAA operational weather satellite era. However, while building a consistent, long-term cloud data record has proven challenging for the two MODIS sensors alone, the transition to VIIRS presents additional challenges due to its lack of key water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels available on MODIS that are used for high cloud detection and cloud-top property retrievals, and a mismatch in the spectral location of the 2.2µm shortwave infrared channels on MODIS and VIIRS that has important implications on inter-sensor consistency of cloud optical/microphysical property retrievals and cloud thermodynamic phase. Moreover, sampling differences between MODIS and VIIRS, including spatial resolution and local observation time, and inter-sensor relative radiometric calibration pose additional challenges. To create a continuous, long-term cloud climate data record that merges the observational records of MODIS and VIIRS while mitigating the impacts of these sensor differences, a common algorithm approach was pursued that utilizes a subset of spectral channels available on each imager. The resulting NASA CLDMSK (cloud mask) and CLDPROP (cloud-top and optical/microphysical properties) products were publicly released for Aqua MODIS and SNPP VIIRS in early 2020, with NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) VIIRS following in early 2021. Here, we present an overview of the MODIS-VIIRS CLDMSK and CLDPROP common algorithm approach, discuss efforts to monitor and address relative radiometric calibration differences, and highlight early analysis of inter-sensor cloud product dataset continuity.",

Moreover, with DNP special experiments have been performed which provide information about the localization and the mobility of the unpaired electrons present in these coals. Finally, DNP has been used to investigate various features of the quantitative analysis of coal via 13C n.m.r. MAS was found to reduce the measured 13C aromaticity, and for three coals it was shown that even without MAS only ≈ 50% of the aromatic 13C nuclei are detected by the CP technique.",

Generally, there was a significant negative effect of overgrowing with tall-growing herbs and shrubs on the abundance of Danish orchids, mainly caused by change of farming practices, as extensive management, such as grazing or mowing of light-open grassland areas, has decreased.",

Devices with gaps ranging from ∼ 2 - 10 nm are fabricated with yields approaching 80%. Highly conjugated bis-oxazole molecules are assembled within the gaps in a sequential fashion, relying upon individually designed end-group chemistry to control the attachment of molecular units to the metal electrodes and the modular assembly of the bis-oxazole units, respectively. In addition, metal ion complexes are used to reversibly attach and detach terpyridyl molecular units from one another. Fully assembled devices display distinctive electrical response, which is strongly modulated by the molecular assembly and attachment.",

      "abstract": "Flood damage models are used to determine the impact of measures to reduce damage due to river flooding. Such models are characterized by uncertainty. This uncertainty may affect the decisions made on the basis of the model outcomes. To reduce uncertainty effectively, the most important sources of uncertainty must be found. Uncertainty analysis serves this purpose. By way of a questionnaire experts were asked about their judgment of the significance of uncertainty sources in flood damage assessment. The results of this questionnaire are compared to an uncertainty analysis by Monte Carlo Simulation, which Torterotot (1993) applied to the French model CIFLUPEDE. The paper concludes that the role of uncertainty in flood damage assessment is highly significant and cannot be neglected. Both the experts and the analysis on the flood damage assessment model indicate the hydrologic relations ‘frequence of occurrence - river discharge - river water level’ and the damage estimates as the most important uncertainty sources. For embanked rivers dike breach is the most significant uncertainty source. A question which appears is, taking into account these uncertainties, to what level of precision can flood damage assessment models predict the expected annual flood damage and the costs and revenues of flood alleviation measures? It is of importance to explore the boundaries of flood damage modeling and to try to find ways to move these boundaries. The uncertainty analysis presented in this paper can be seen as one more step on the way to this goal.",

      "abstract": "Cell cultures of Morinda citrifolia L. are capable of accumulating substantial amounts of anthraquinones. Chorismate formed by the shikimate pathway is an important precursor of these secondary metabolites. Isochorismate synthase (EC 5.4.99.6), the enzyme that channels chorismate into the direction of the anthraquinones, is involved in the regulation of anthraquinone biosynthesis. Other enzymes of the shikimate pathway such as deoxy-D- arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.2.15) and chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) do not play a regulatory role in the process. The accumulation of anthraquinones is correlated with isochorismate synthase activity under a variety of conditions, which indicates that under most circumstances the concentration of the branchpoint metabolite chorismate is not a rate-limiting factor. Anthraquinone biosynthesis in Morinda is strongly inhibited by 2,4-D, but much less by NAA. Both auxins inhibit the activity of isochorismate synthase proportionally to the concomitant reduction in the amount of anthraquinone accumulated. However, the correlation between enzyme activity and rate of biosynthesis is less clear when the activity of the enzyme is very high. In this case, a limiting concentration of precursor may determine the extent of anthraquinone accumulation. Partial inhibition of chorismate biosynthesis by glyphosate leads to less anthraquinone accumulation, but also to a reduction in ICS activity. The complexity of the interference of glyphosate with anthraquinone biosynthesis is illustrated by the effect of the inhibitor in cell cultures of the related species Rubia tinctorum L. In these cells, glyphosate leads to an increase in anthraquinone content and a concomitant rise in ICS activity. All data indicate that the main point of regulation in anthraquinone biosynthesis is located at the entrance of the specific secondary route.",

Methods: Twenty-one RTW case managers and 29 DC experts were interviewed by telephone using a semi-structured interview schedule. Results: The RTW case managers valued the utility of FCE on a scale of 0–10. Their mean valuation was 6.5 (SD 1.5). The average valuation for DC experts was 4.8 (SD 2.2). Arguments in favor of FCE were (1) its ability to confirm own opinions and (2) the objectivity of its measurement method. Arguments against FCE were (1) the redundancy of the information it provides and (2) the lack of objectivity. Indications for FCE were musculoskeletal disorders, a positive patient self-perception of ability to work, and the presence of an actual job. Contraindications for FCE were medically unexplained disorders, a negative patient self-perception of ability to work, and the existence of disputes and legal procedures. Conclusions: The responding RTW case managers perceived FCE to be more useful than the responding DC experts. The question of whether the arguments presented for and against the utility of FCE are valid is one that should be addressed in a future study.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new version of the EMEP MSC-W model called eEMEP developed for transportation and dispersion of volcanic emissions, both gases and ash. EMEP MSC-W is usually applied to study problems with air pollution and aerosol transport and requires some adaptation to treat volcanic eruption sources and effluent dispersion. The operational set-up of model simulations in case of a volcanic eruption is described. Important choices have to be made to achieve CPU efficiency so that emergency situations can be tackled in time, answering relevant questions of ash advisory authorities. An efficient model needs to balance the complexity of the model and resolution. We have investigated here a meteorological uncertainty component of the volcanic cloud forecast by using a consistent ensemble meteorological dataset (GLAMEPS forecast) at three resolutions for the case of SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from the 2014 Barðarbunga eruption. The low resolution (40 × 40 km) ensemble members show larger agreement in plume position and intensity, suggesting that the ensemble here does not give much added value. To compare the dispersion at different resolutions, we compute the area where the column load of the volcanic tracer, here SO<SUB>2</SUB>, is above a certain threshold, varied for testing purposes between 0.25 and 50 Dobson units. The increased numerical diffusion causes a larger area (+34 %) to be covered by the volcanic tracer in the low resolution simulations than in the high resolution ones. The higher resolution (10 × 10 km) ensemble members show higher column loads farther away from the volcanic eruption site in narrower clouds. Cloud positions are more varied between the high resolution members, and the cloud forms resemble the observed clouds more than the low resolution ones. For a volcanic emergency case this means that to obtain quickly results of the transport of volcanic emissions, an individual simulation with our low resolution is sufficient; however, to forecast peak concentrations with more certainty for forecast or scientific analysis purposes, a finer resolution is needed. The model is further developed to simulate ash from highly explosive eruptions. A possibility of increasing the number of vertical layers, achieving finer vertical resolution, as well as a higher model top, is included in the eEMEP version. Ash size distributions may be altered for different volcanic eruptions and assumptions. Since ash particles are larger than typical particles in the standard model, gravitational settling across all vertical layers is included. We attempt finally a specific validation of the simulation of ash and its vertical distribution. Model simulations with and without gravitational settling for the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption are compared to lidar observations over central Europe. The results show that with gravitation the centre of the ash mass can be 1 km lower over central Europe than without gravitation. However, the height variations in the ash layer caused by real weather situations are not captured perfectly well by either of the two simulations, playing down the role of gravitation parameterization imperfections. Both model simulations have on average an ash centre of mass below the observed values. Correlations between the observed and corresponding model centres of mass are higher for the model simulation with gravitational settling for four of the six stations studied here. The inclusion of gravitational settling is suggested to be required for a volcanic ash model.",

At all pressures the dominant DNP mechanism was a positive Overhauser enhancement, caused by proton-electron contact interactions at the fluid/solid radical interface. The observed enhancements varied from 12 at 60 bar to 17 at 300 bar. Besides the Overhauser enhancement, small solid state and thermal mixing enhancements also were observed, indicating that part of the ethylene was adsorbed at the radical surface for a prolonged time. The impacts of the experimental conditions on the Overhauser enhancement factors are discussed, and enhancements of at least 40-60 are estimated when the EPR saturation factor and the leakage factor become maximal. These data indicate that DNP-enhanced NMR has the potential of extending the impact of NMR in research areas involving supercritical fluids.",

Assessment of the risk that results from concentrations that occur in drinking water will be dependent upon the mode of action held responsible for these tumors. A study by Stauber and Bull [Stauber, A.J. and Bull, R.J (1997) Differences in phenotype and cell replicative behavior of hepatic tumors inducted by dichloroacetate (DCA) and trichloroacetate (TCA). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 144, 235–246] in mice treated with DCA demonstrated a lesion distribution that was skewed towards many small, altered foci of cells that are assumed to be precursor lesions [EPA, (1996). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Proposed Guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment; notice. Fed. Reg. 61, pp. 17 960–10 811]. The present study was designed to determine the extent to which the tumorigenic effects of DCA could be explained by its effect on tumor growth rates (i.e. tumor promoting activity). In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowed accurate determination of growth rates of individual lesions in mice that had been treated with DCA in drinking water at 2 g/l. Out of thirty treated mice, ten were found to have hepatic tumors detectable by MRI at 48 weeks of treatment. These tumor-bearing animals were assigned to two groups matched on the size of lesions observed by in vivo MR1. Treatment with DCA continued in one group of five mice and was stopped in the other. For both groups, tumor growth rates were determined by measuring changes in size of all lesions greater than 1 mm <SUP>3</SUP> in volume during a 14-day period. Removal of DCA treatment resulted in growth rates that could not be distinguished from zero across all lesion sizes represented in the sample. These data are in agreement with previous observations of DCAs effects on replication rates within tumors (Stauber and Bull, (1997)). Tumor growth rates observed in animals maintained on treatment decreased with lesion volume in a manner that is consistent with a stochastic Gompertz birth-death process proposed by Tan [Tan, W.Y. (1986) A stochastic Gompertz birth-death process. Stat. Prob. Lett. 4, 25–28]. Parameters of this model obtained by fitting measured growth rates were used to predict the lesion-size distribution expected after one year of DCA treatment. The shape of the predicted lesion-size distribution was similar to that observed by Stauber and Bull (Stauber and Bull, (1997)) in mice sacrificed after 40 weeks of DCA treatment. We conclude that the effects of DCA on the division and/or death rates of spontaneously initiated cells can account for the predominance of small lesions in DCA-treated animals.",

This increase is up to two orders of magnitude higher than comparable values in other cities. In this investigation, we examine the role of topographically induced circulation as a contributor to the CO2 dome. A three-dimensional time-dependent regional model shows that frequently occurring katabatic winds generate a mesoscale circulation in Phoenix conducive to the accumulation of CO2 in the center of the city. We conclude that local topography and associated circulation regimes are important in understanding the high levels of CO2 in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Copyright",

Previous research has hypothesized that a combination of katabatic flow, barrier winds, and mesoscale and synoptic-scale cyclones drive the RAS. Within the RAS, an area of maximum wind speed is located to the northwest of the protruding Prince Olav Mountains. In this region, the Sabrina automatic weather station (AWS) observed a September 2009 high wind event with wind speeds in excess of 20 m s−1 for nearly 35 h. The following case study uses in situ AWS observations and output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System to demonstrate that the strong wind speeds during this event were caused by a combination of various forcing mechanisms, including katabatic winds, barrier winds, a surface mesocyclone over the Ross Ice Shelf, an upper-level ridge over the southern tip of the Ross Ice Shelf, and topographic influences from the Prince Olav Mountains. These forcing mechanisms induced a barrier wind corner jet to the northwest of the Prince Olav Mountains, explaining the maximum wind speeds observed in this region. The RAS wind speeds were strong enough to induce two additional barrier wind corner jets to the northwest of the Prince Olav Mountains, resulting in a triple barrier wind corner jet along the base of the Transantarctic Mountains.",

Hydrographic data from 1991, 1993 and 2004 show that subtropical waters are common in Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord (KF), and that surface waters were warm in 2004 relative to 1991 and 1993. The main water column was nonetheless warmest in 1991. We contend that while flow of subtropical waters into fjords provides a setting in which rapid glacier retreat can occur, the triggering of retreat depends on additional environmental factors. The climatic variables standing out in our study of KG and KF are air temperature and katabatic winds. Both had strong positive anomalies during winter 2004/05, when KG retreated. We show that proglacial ice melange was absent and that fjord freeze-up did not occur until 11 April 2005, due to warm and windy conditions. We demonstrate that this setting is unusual and hypothesize that exposure to open water in winter months caused the retreat. Calculation of ice-front melt rates shows that discharge of basal meltwater, first from runoff and subsequently from frictional basal heating, should intensify the interaction between glacier and fjord.",

They are characterized by high acidity accompanying the high electrical conductivity, so that the hydrogen ion is the dominant ion, coupling with chloride and nitrate ions. The chemical composition differs sharply from sea salts. These characteristics appear more clearly than previously reported in Antarctica and are most strongly developed in snow samples from the high region. The tritium content increases in the inland high area, especially in the region higher than 3600 m asl (above sea level), which corresponds to the region where the effects of katabatic wind have vanished in the glaciological observations. The highest tritium content occurs in the vertical profile at a snow pit (3761 m asl, 77°00'S, 35°00'E), which corresponds to the snow deposition in 1966. The concentration is the highest ever reported in Antarctica and is almost as high as the one observed in the precipitation in the inland region of North America, which is the highest value ever reported in the world. All the results suggest that most of the ions contained in snow samples from the inland high plateau, especially higher than 3600 m asl, are not brought directly through the troposphere from the sea around Antarctica but from the higher atmosphere and that they are under the influence of the physicochemical reactions occurring there.",

      "abstract": "Water stable isotopes signals recorded in snow, firn and ice cores were successfully used to investigate past temperatures on glacial/interglacial scales (Jouzel and Masson-Delmotte 2010, Dansgaard, 1964). However, as evidenced by Goursaud et al. (2018) in coastal Adélie Land, many uncertainties hampered the interpretation of water isotope records at sub-annual to decadal resolution as a proxy of past temperature variations only (Goursaud et al. 2018). Condensation, sublimation and/or redistribution of snow triggered by strong katabatic winds as well as precipitation intermittencies, origin of moist air masses bringing precipitation and diffusion within firn lessen the representativity of a single isotopic profile to reconstruct past temperature in this region (Grazioli et al. 2017, Khale et al. 2018, Picard et al. 2019, Casado et al. 2020, Hirsch et al. 2023). In order to mitigate the non-representativity of a single isotopic profile, a solution consists in averaging several records to increase signal to noise ratios. However, to do so, it is necessary to provide a good correspondence between the different cores of interest.In this study, we make good use of water stable isotopes and major chemistry records from 9 firn core (20 to 40m deep) drilled at 3 sites (so called D47, Stop5 and Stop0) during the ASUMA campaign. These sites display a high mean accumulation rate of about 250 mm.weq/year and a wide range of environmental conditions with elevation ranging from 1550m to 2460m, distance from coast ranging from 103km to 423km and different katabatic winds influence. In particular, we use the Paleochrono probabilistic model with water stable isotopes signal and major chemistry records coupled with beta-gamma and RADAR data to obtain the best correspondence between the different cores. We then quantify to what extent the stacking of several cores enable to increase the signal to noise ratio at the different sites and can provide a faithful record to document variations of the temperature and/or atmospheric water cycle over the last decades in this region.",

The northern and northeastern winds noted in the loess succession separated by a period when southwestern to southeastern winds were predominant may be correlated with two main phases of ice-sheet advance during the Last Glacial Maximum. The ice-sheet advances towards the areas of loess deposition generated katabatic winds that influenced aeolian sedimentation in the periglacial zone. A period of relatively stable wind directions during a younger phase of the Last Glacial Maximum was interrupted by periods with more chaotic wind regime most probably caused by fluctuations of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet during its retreat from the peri-Baltic part of Europe. These intervals occur where initial soils developed. The distribution of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility axes defined along the periglacial loess sections from central and eastern Europe can serve to constrain fluctuations of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet.",

This jet is modeled as a balanced flow that satisfies the potential vorticity invertibility principle, based on local linear balance in spherical coordinates and expressed in isentropic coordinates. In this way, this easterly low-level jet is shown to be the balanced flow associated with the topography of the Antarctic plateau, moderated by a shallow potential vorticity anomaly atop the plateau produced by radiative cooling. The dynamical connection of the jet with katabatic winds can be understood through the meridional circulation equation. Model results based on the simple theoretical arguments developed here are found to be consistent with high-resolution reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for the 2008-2010 period.",

The atmospheric component of the model is compared with Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) data and shows a significantly increased skill over the ECMWF atmospheric variables. During winter, the sea ice production in TNB is largely determined by katabatic winds. We estimate the monthly production rate to be 8.7 km<SUP>3</SUP>/month of sea ice during winter. In early summer (November), the katabatics are weaker and the sea ice production is more influenced by the synoptic wind. The net sea ice production is weaker during November at 1.2 km<SUP>3</SUP>/month. The summer production is characterized by a diurnal cycle of melt and sea ice formation. For small coastal polynyas, like TNB, it is important to resolve all the glacier valleys accurately. Increasing the model resolution by a factor of five leads to a doubling of the sea ice formation during winter simulations due to the point intensity of the katabatics winds. For open coastal polynyas, like RIS polynya, sea ice production is largely controlled by synoptic winds and resolution is less important. The RIS polynya production is 61.3 km<SUP>3</SUP> during winter and 19.1 km<SUP>3</SUP> during November. These results are comparable to RIS polynya observations. Although the TNB polynya has a smaller winter sea ice production, the sea ice rate of growth per unit area is 1.6 times that of the RIS polynya.",

      "abstract": "Continental wind storms are common along the Mediterranean coast. Along the northern coast they are mostly cold, similar to the Bora or the Mistral, and along the southern coast they are mostly warm, e.g., the Ghibli or the Shirocco. At the eastern Mediterranean basin and the Levant region, these storms are intermittently warm and cold during the same season and often even during the same event. Quasi-stationary systems, as well as moving disturbances, are the cause of such wind storms. Accordingly, the resulting weather conditions may be extremely converse due to the characteristics of the advected airmass. Specific regions in Israel, sensitive to easterly storms, are influenced by these wind storms for about 10% of the year (e.g., the westerly slopes of the mountains and valleys with west-east orientation). The frequency, however, of widespread storms covering the entire region is only approximately 1.4% of the entire year. These wind storms are therefore classified in the present study according to their climatological and synoptic characteristics; indicating that the dominant synoptic situation is the Red-Sea trough and the warm advections. These storms appear only from October-May and are most frequent during the cold season. The diurnal course is characterized by a strengthening in the morning hours and a weakening at noon and in the afternoon hours, due to the opposing effect of the westerly sea breeze, suppressing the easterly winds and the effect of katabatic winds. Nevertheless, synoptic conditions may contribute to this tendency as well. Accordingly, a significant increase in the frequencies of easterly storms, in relation to distance from the seashore has been identified. Although most of the stormy days are with westerly winds, the easterly wind storms has vast environmental implications, creating damage especially to agriculture and occasionally also to property and life; coastal flooding, potential air pollution, intensifying of forest fires and occasionally dust and sand storms.",

In this study, we use a regional coupled atmosphere-sea ice model to investigate the role of atmospheric forcing of the polynyas in this area. The model successfully simulates both latent and sensible heat polynyas which are found in the region. In particular, a deep-ocean polynya is formed coincident with the passage of an atmospheric synoptic scale system. The divergence in the sea ice is found to be highly correlated with the atmospheric divergence. We conclude that the initial formation of a polynya can be caused by the interaction of the atmospheric synoptic scale and the continental katabatic wind regimes. While we cannot directly evaluate the role of the ocean using the present model simulations, we performed experiments with different levels of prescribed basal heat flux. These experiments highlight a polynya which could be initiated by the winds and maintained by the oceanic heat. This leads to the concept of a wind-driven sensible heat polynya, not typical of other deep-ocean polynyas such as the Weddell polynya of the 1970s.",

      "abstract": "The Greenland Ice Sheet is the primary source of global Barystatic sea level rise, and at least half of its recent mass loss acceleration is caused by surface meltwater runoff. Previous studies on surface melt have examined various thermodynamic and dynamic drivers, yet their contributions are not compared using unified observations. We use decade long in situ measurements from automatic weather stations throughout the ablation zone to assess energy components and identify the leading physical processes in this area. Large melt events exceeding 3σ contribute only ∼2% to total surface melt since 2007. The day to day variability of all melt is dominated by sensible heat exchange (31 ± 7%) and shortwave radiation (28 ± 5%). Sensible and solar heating correlate with the occurrence of dry and fast gravity driven winds. These katabatic winds increase sensible heating of the surface mainly by enhancing vertical mixing that reduces the temperature inversion. The concomitant low humidity and clear skies yield increased solar heating.",

With nearly a 20- and 18-year data record for MODIS Terra and Aqua, respectively, the cloud products are just beginning to be useful for climate analyses. However, the utility of the data records for this purpose fundamentally depends on instrument stability. The most recent MODIS Atmosphere Team reprocessing (Collection 6.1) addressed continuing instrument degradation in both MODIS instruments, most notably the increasing cross-talk occurring in several MODIS Terra infrared channels that resulted in pronounced artifacts in cloud detection trends for the later years of the Collection 6.0 time series. Previously, Collection 5 cloud property products showed artifacts in trends and ENSO correlations associated with scan-dependent shortwave channel radiometric calibration degradation, particularly for MODIS Terra. While the older MODIS Terra imager has had the more significant degradation issues, MODIS Aqua is showing analogous radiometric issues. We will present an overview of how Terra instrument temporal artifacts aliased into the cloud products in previous collections, and showcase the improvements seen in the recent 6.1 Level-1B (instrument) and Level-2 cloud product reprocessing. Terra analyses will include time series trends for a variety of cloud products as well as product correlations associated with ENSO phases.",

      "abstract": "Specific environmental release categories (SPERCs) are an instrument for lower-tier environmental emissions assessments. They support chemical safety assessments under the European Union (EU) regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals. SPERCs have been developed by industry and subjected to regulatory review. Within the framework of the Chemical Safety Report/Exposure Scenario Roadmap, the EU Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the EU Member State authorities, and European industry sector associations collaborate to improve the quality of the SPERCs. Following up on the outcome of ECHA's SPERC Best Practice Project, industry, together with ECHA, developed an updated SPERC factsheet template and guidance on how to fill it out. In addition, industry developed 2 sets of SPERC factsheet examples and the corresponding SPERC background documents. These documents were submitted to a multistakeholder review process. The comments from the review were discussed at a workshop in spring 2016. The workshop participants acknowledged the revised factsheet format including the corresponding guidance, the 2 SPERC factsheets, and the 2 SPERC background documents as best practice examples. The package is expected to support further improvement of the quality of the SPERCs. A common understanding was achieved of the need to match the level of detail of the use conditions description with the risk to be controlled (i.e., the emission intensity and hazard profile of the substances) and with the level of conservatism of SPERC release factors. The complete and transparent documentation of the derivation of the release factors and of their conservatism is conceived as crucial for the credibility of the SPERCs, such that they can be trusted by partners in the chemicals supply chain and by regulators. To that end, background documents will include a dedicated section describing the conservatism of SPERCs. The workshop concluded with an outline of the practical way forward for the improvement of SPERC documentation. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:815-820.",

The Cross-platform HIgh resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system addresses the latter aspect of the inter-sensor continuity problem for cloud property retrievals by removing retrieval methodology and implementation as a source of inconsistency when applied to instruments that share common measurement capabilities. <P />Transferring an existing retrieval algorithm to a new sensor oftentimes is a nontrivial task, as it is common for an algorithm code to be tightly coupled to the sensor for which it was developed. By creating a clear division between the science algorithm and the instrument I/O codes, CHIMAERA allows easy migration of science algorithms to different sensors. CHIMAERA is built from C and FORTRAN source code, and can operate in a variety of environments ranging from a personal laptop to a high-performance computing environment for near real-time satellite data production. It is highly adaptable, low-maintenance and allows for easy expansion such that adding new instruments into the system requires only instrument-specific I/O and provision of any external lookup tables specific to the instrument's spectral characteristics. <P />CHIMAERA currently supports 14 spaceborne and airborne atmospheric imagers from a single code base, and has been in use since 2007. In this paper we describe the engineering aspects of CHIMAERA and briefly discuss a few examples from its many current applications.",

      "abstract": "When considering relationships between genotype and phenotype we frequently ignore the fact that the genome of a typical animal, notably including that of a fish and a human, harbours a huge amount of foreign DNA. Such DNA, in the form of transposable elements, can affect genome function in a major way, and transgene biology needs to be included in our understanding of the genome. Here we examine an unexpected phenotypic effect of the chromosomally integrated transgene fli1a-F-hsp70l:Gal4VP16 that serves as a model for transgene function generally. We examine larval fras1 mutant zebrafish (Danio rerio). Gal4VP16 is a potent transcriptional activator that is already well known for toxicity and mediating unusual transcriptional effects. In the presence of the transgene, phenotypes in the neural crest-derived craniofacial skeleton, notably fusions and shape changes associated with loss of function fras1 mutations, are made more severe, as we quantify by scoring phenotypic penetrance, the fraction of mutants expressing the trait. A very interesting feature is that the enhancements are highly specific for fras1 mutant phenotypes, occurring in the apparent absence of more widespread changes. Except for the features due to the fras1 mutation, the transgene-bearing larvae appear generally healthy and to be developing normally. The transgene behaves as a genetic partial dominant: a single copy is sufficient for the enhancements, yet, for some traits, two copies may exert a stronger effect. We made new strains bearing independent insertions of the fli1a-F-hsp70l:Gal4VP16 transgene in new locations in the genome, and observed increased severities of the same phenotypes as observed for the original insertion. This finding suggests that sequences within the transgene, for example Gal4VP16, are responsible for the enhancements, rather than the effect on neighbouring host sequences (such as an insertional mutation). The specificity and biological action underlying the traits are subjects of considerable interest for further investigation, as we discuss. Our findings show that work with transgenes needs to be undertaken with caution and attention to detail.",

The research question was: what is the association between selected person-related factors and work participation of workers with health problems? A systematic review was carried out in PubMed and PsycINFO to search for original papers published between January 2007 and February 2017. The risk of bias of the studies included was assessed using quality assessment tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework for prognostic studies. In total, 113 studies were included, all of which addressed the association between person-related factors and work participation. The factors positively associated with work participation were positive expectations regarding recovery or return to work, optimism, self-efficacy, motivation, feelings of control, and perceived health. The factors negatively associated with work participation were fear-avoidance beliefs, perceived work-relatedness of the health problem, and catastrophizing. Different coping strategies had a negative or a positive relationship with work participation. The results of this review provide more insight into the associations between different cognitions and perceptions and work participation. The results of this study suggest that person-related factors should be considered by occupational- and insurance physicians when they diagnose, evaluate or provide treatment to employees. Further research is required to determine how these physicians could obtain and apply such information and whether its application leads to a better quality of care.",

Semi-metallic character is observed in the temperature (T) variation of resistivity (ρ), following ρ(T) ∝ T<SUP>2</SUP> at low temperature with a slope compatible with the usual spin-fluctuating system. Magnetoresistance (MR) at 2 K is negative and strongly dependent on the direction of the magnetic field (H) with respect to the crystallographic c-axis. MR changes sign with increasing temperature above ∼ 100 K, when H is applied along the c-axis. Hall measurements indicate the p-type conductivity with a considerable hole concentration of ∼ 8.7 × 10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reproduces the reported results and confirms a peculiar dispersion shape of the hole-like band at the bulk high-symmetry T point near the Fermi energy indicating band inversion. Magnetic hysteresis measurement at 2 K shows diamagnetic behaviour at high-H, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM)-like magnetic hysteresis loop is observed at low-H in between ± 4 kOe. The FM component disappears close to 3 K. Signature of spin-fluctuation in ρ(T), negative MR, and low-T FM component without 3d or 4f impurities in GaGeTe is attractive for the fundamental interest.",

      "abstract": "The Dutch policy objective of a fully sustainable livestock sector without mutilations by 2023 is not compatible with the routine practice of tail docking to minimize the risk of tail biting. To examine farmer attitudes towards docking, a telephone survey was conducted among 487 conventional and 33 organic Dutch pig farmers. \"Biting\" (of tails, ears, or limbs) was identified by the farmers as a main welfare problem in pig farming. About half of the farmers reported to have no tail biting problems in their own herd. When farmers did report problems, they most often reported figures between 1 and 5 % of the animals. High incidences of tail biting were anticipated when trying to keep undocked pigs. Enrichment materials used in the conventional sector included mainly chains (52–63 % of the farms) and hanging rubber or plastic balls (22–30 %). Straw, sawdust, or wood shavings was hardly provided in conventional pig farming (2–3 %), in contrast to organic farming (88–100 % of farms). Conventional pig farmers feel a curly tail is not very important for sustainable pig farming. They consider enrichment to be less effective and tail docking to be less stressful for them and their piglets than their organic colleagues do. Pig farmers identified climate as a main risk factor for tail biting as opposed to enrichment. The objective of reducing routine tail docking requires solutions for dealing with tail biting problems at the farm level. In this process, transfer of scientific knowledge about enrichment materials and other measures to prevent and cure tail biting is critical, as is a change in farmer attitudes and awareness of the moral issues involved.",

Characterization of 46 cloned amplificates, differing in sequence and size (1.2–1.6 kb), revealed the ubiquitous occurrence of legumin genes and their organization in small subfamilies in the 22 species investigated. The 3‧ portions of the genes, coding for the legumin β-polypeptides, show a highly conserved intron/exon structure divergent from those of angiosperms: an additional intron (intron IV) uniformly interrupts the region coding for the C-terminal part of the β-polypeptides. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective coding sequences as well as the organization of the Magnolia B14 legumin gene also investigated here both indicate that intron IV is ancestral and was lost during early angiosperm evolution. Taking into account the intronlexon structures from all legumin genes known, our results suggest that legumin genes evolved by subsequent loss of introns, providing also further evidence for a common origin of legumins and vicilins.",

A cloudy pixel is usually assumed to be horizontally homogeneous in the retrieval. Ignoring sub-pixel variations of cloud reflectances can lead to a significant bias in the retrieved τ and r<SUB>e</SUB>. In this study, we use the Taylor expansion of a two-variable function to understand and quantify the impacts of sub-pixel variances of VIS/NIR and SWIR cloud reflectances and their covariance on the τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals. This framework takes into account the fact that the retrievals are determined by both VIS/NIR and SWIR band observations in a mutually dependent way. In comparison with previous studies, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of how sub-pixel cloud reflectance variations impact the τ and r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals based on the bi-spectral method. In particular, our framework provides a mathematical explanation of how the sub-pixel variation in VIS/NIR band influences the r<SUB>e</SUB> retrieval and why it can sometimes outweigh the influence of variations in the SWIR band and dominate the error in r<SUB>e</SUB> retrievals, leading to a potential contribution of positive bias to the r<SUB>e</SUB> retrieval.",

      "abstract": "The MODIS imagers on the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua satellites have generated accurate and well-used cloud climate data records for 15 years. Both missions are expected to continue until the end of this decade and perhaps beyond. The Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagers on the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) mission (launched in October 2011) and future NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) platforms are the successors for imager-based cloud climate records from polar orbiting satellites after MODIS. To ensure product continuity across a broad suite of EOS products, NASA has funded a SNPP science team to develop EOS-like algorithms that can be use with SNPP and JPSS observations, including two teams to work on cloud products. Cloud data record continuity between MODIS and VIIRS is particularly challenging due to the lack of VIIRS CO2-slicing channels, which reduces information content for cloud detection and cloud-top property products, as well as down-stream cloud optical products that rely on both. Here we report on our approach to providing continuity specifically for the MODIS/VIIRS cloud-top and infrared-derived thermodynamic phase products by combining elements of the NASA MODIS science team (MOD) and the NOAA Algorithm Working Group (AWG) algorithms. The combined approach is referred to as the MODAWG processing package. In collaboration with the NASA Atmospheric SIPS located at the University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center, the MODAWG code has been exercised on one year of SNPP VIIRS data. In addition to cloud-top and phase, MODAWG provides a full suite of cloud products that are physically consistent with MODIS and have a similar data format. Further, the SIPS has developed tools to allow use of Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) observations in the MODAWG processing that can ameliorate the loss of the CO2 absorption channels on VIIRS. Examples will be given that demonstrate the positive impact that the CrIS data can provide when combined with VIIRS for cloud height and IR-phase retrievals.",

During the etch, the chlorine plasma emission intensity is monitored, providing a distinct signature when etching through the thin AlO(x) layer and a sharp indication of endpoint as the underlying SiO2 is reached. The etch sequence is programmed to maintain the wafer temperature below 100 C at all times. This process has been used to fabricate a variety of Josephson devices using 2.0 micron groundrules and high quality Josephson junctions as small as 0.5 sq micron in area. In a variation on this process, using direct write electron-beam lithography, we have fabricated niobium features as small as 0.15 micron.",

      "abstract": "To study the complementary value of information from functional capacity evaluation (FCE) for insurance physicians (IPs) who assess the physical work ability of claimants with long-term musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). A post-test only design was used in the context of disability claims. Twenty-eight IPs participated in the study. Claimants with MSD formed the patient population. For each IP, the first claimant who agreed to participate was included in the study, and underwent FCE in addition to the regular disability claim assessment. Firstly, the IP performed the statutory disability claim assessment. Secondly, the FCE assessment took place. Finally, a self-formulated questionnaire was presented to the IPs after they viewed the FCE report. IPs were asked whether they perceived FCE information to be of complementary value to their judgment of the claimant's physical work ability investigated. We considered FCE information to be of complementary value if more than 66% of the IPs indicated as such. IPs were also asked whether FCE information led them to change their initial judgment about the claimant's physical work ability, and whether they felt this information made them more confident about their ultimate judgement. Finally, they were asked whether they planned to include FCE information in future disability claims and for what type of claimants. Differences between IPs who did or did not experience complementary value were explored. Of the 28, 19 (nearly 68%) IPs considered FCE information to be of complementary value for their assessment of claimants with MSD. Half of the IPs stated that FCE information reinforced their judgment. All but four IPs changed their assessment after reading the FCE report. Sixteen IPs intended to involve FCE information in future disability claim assessments. There were no observed differences between the IPs who did or did not consider the FCE information to be of complementary value. FCE information was found to have complementary value at present and in the future according to most IPs in the assessment of the physical work ability of claimants with MSD. Half of the IPs felt that this information reinforces their judgment in this context.",

For MODIS Collection 6 (C6), the multilayer cloud classification algorithm has been updated, including modifications to existing spectral tests and revised output information, as well as a new test based on the Pavolonis and Heidinger algorithm. To evaluate the MODIS C6 multilayer cloud classification, we have developed a MODIS-CALIOP collocated dataset from which a statistical comparison with active lidar multilayer cloud detection can be performed. Here, we present initial results from this analysis and demonstrate that the performance of the MODIS multilayer cloud classification against CALIOP is quite sensitive to how you define multilayer cloud from CALIOP.",

Up to now, the effect of the additional energy consumption of auxiliary loads, such as the HVAC system, is often not investigated in detail. To close this gap for various fuel cell based drivetrains this paper applies a novel approach of Hollweck [1] and analyzes the holistic energy demand under realistic boundary conditions with a validated total vehicle simulation model. Thereby the drivetrains of a midsized fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), fuel cell plug-in electric vehicle (FC-PHEV) as well as the fuel cell range-extended electric vehicle (FC-REEV) are considered. In a first step, the novel approach, which regards the influence of the user behavior, the vehicle properties, the climate boundaries and the starting conditions is introduced. In a second step, the total vehicle simulation model consisting of the vehicle architecture, the drivetrain topology with its electrical and mechanical components, the thermal management of the drivetrain and the thermal management of the vehicle cabin is explained, verified and parameterized. In a final step, the seasonal and yearly energy demand for different driving profiles (urban, rural and motorway) and German weather conditions as well as the influence of colder winter conditions is analyzed. The detected varying auxiliary loads' influence on the different fuel cell based drivetrains is shown and discussed. Thereby, one of the results is that the auxiliary loads' impact on FCEVs is moderate, while the impact on FC-PHEVs and FC-REEVs - driven in battery - mode is significant. Especially in cold winter conditions this effect is substantial.",

However, there is a need for integrated assessment of critical management points for minimizing this potential. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing data were analysed to comprehensively compare total ARG profiles characteristic of amendments (manure or compost) derived from either beef or dairy cattle (with and without dosing antibiotics according to conventional practice), soil (loamy sand or silty clay loam) and vegetable (lettuce or radish) samples collected across studies carried out at laboratory-, microcosm- and greenhouse-scale. Vegetables carried the greatest diversity of ARGs (n = 838) as well as the most ARG-mobile genetic element co-occurrences (n = 945). Radishes grown in manure- or compost-amended soils harboured a higher relative abundance of total (0.91 and 0.91 ARGs/16S rRNA gene) and clinically relevant ARGs than vegetables from other experimental conditions (average: 0.36 ARGs/16S rRNA gene). Lettuce carried the highest relative abundance of pathogen gene markers among the metagenomes examined. Total ARG relative abundances were highest on vegetables grown in loamy sand receiving antibiotic-treated beef amendments. The findings emphasize that additional barriers, such as post-harvest processes, merit further study to minimize potential exposure to consumers.",

Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to go beyond the often-used ensemble-averaged view of non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of quasiparticle temperature evolutions. We show for ferromagnetic Ni that the non-equilibrium electron and spin dynamics display pronounced variations with electron momentum, whereas the magnetic exchange interaction remains isotropic. This highlights the influence of lattice-mediated scattering processes and opens a pathway toward unraveling the still elusive microscopic mechanism of spin-lattice angular momentum transfer. Non-equilibrium phonon-electron scattering leads to momentum-dependent transient electron and spin populations in Ni.",

The more severe the weather conditions the higher the frequency of the white phenotype. The colouring agents in the petals are all flavonol glucosides; in the yellow flowers gossypitrin (1) and herbacitrin (2), in the white ones the kaempferol glucoside astragalin (3). Only astragalin shows UV reflection, which is valuable in attracting insect pollinators, so very likely the presence of astragalin may be responsible for the success of the white-flowered type under suboptimal weather conditions. We were unable to confirm the hypothesis that the yellow colouring agents, gossypitrin and herbacitrin, should be more costly to produce than the white one, astragalin, as an investment in order to obtain the higher temperature observed in yellow flowers. The distribution pattern with high frequency of the yellow-flowered poppies where the likelihood of sunshine is high, may have other reasons than carbon allocation to the colouring agents. Yellow flowers are more showy than white ones, and although this in general benefits pollination it may also increase the risk of herbivory. White flowers are at the same time believed to escape herbivory and obtain a better pollination under dull weather conditions, due to the UV-reflection by astragalin.",

An extensive search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL for English-, Dutch- and German-language studies searching on synonyms of the terms chronic disease, WR and RTW. Studies were selected if they described factors related to WR or RTW and included participants with a chronic disease of working age (15–67 years old). From 2597 hits in the electronic databases, we identified six studies reporting 23 factors associated with work participation. Categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, health-related factors (comorbidity, duration of symptoms and less dysfunction), environmental factors (work environment and duration of absence) and personal factors (age, gender, education and own prediction of RTW) were identified. Various disease-generic factors are associated with work participation, of which most of the reported factors are independent of diagnosis. Evidence of the retrieved factors is restricted due to the limited availability of studies focusing on disease-generic factors and overall low quality of the retrieved studies.",

Animal studies demonstrated that a reduction in renal filtration and perfusion in both kidneys, and a decline in tubular organic anion transport in the treated kidney characterizes the acute (hours) functional response to unilateral percutaneous access. The acute morphologic and histological changes in the treated kidney were consistent with blunt trauma and ischemia. Only tubular organic anion transport remained depressed during the late (3-day) response to the access procedure. Human studies revealed an acute decline in glomerular function and bilateral renal vasoconstriction following unilateral PCNL. Therefore, percutaneous access is not a benign procedure, but is associated with acute functional and structural derangements.",

We used machine learning methods to determine factors associated with the decision to extubate the critically ill patient at the end of life, and whether the terminal extubation shortens the dying process. We performed a secondary data analysis of a large, prospective, multicentre, cohort study, death prediction and physiology after removal of therapy (DePPaRT), which collected baseline data as well as ECG, pulse oximeter and arterial waveforms from WLST until 30 min after death. We analysed a priori defined factors associated with the decision to perform terminal extubation in WLST using the random forest method and logistic regression. Cox regression was used to analyse the effect of terminal extubation on time from WLST to death. A total of 616 patients were included into the analysis, out of which 396 (64.3%) were terminally extubated. The study centre, low or no vasopressor support, and good respiratory function were factors significantly associated with the decision to extubate. Unadjusted time to death did not differ between patients with and without extubation (median survival time extubated vs. not extubated: 60 [95% CI: 46; 76] vs. 58 [95% CI: 45; 75] min). In contrast, after adjustment for confounders, time to death of extubated patients was significantly shorter (49 [95% CI: 40; 62] vs. 85 [95% CI: 61; 115] min). The decision to terminally extubate is associated with specific centres and less respiratory and/or vasopressor support. In this context, terminal extubation was associated with a shorter time to death.",

The environmental footprint of fish farming depends largely on the method of production. Trout production in the temperate climate zone in open flow-through systems using the natural hydraulic gradient of streams as freshwater supply is energy efficient relative to more intensive systems. To investigate the possibility of reducing global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and ozone layer depletion associated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) production in southern Germany, a comprehensive dataset collected under the typical farm framework was analyzed and a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was conducted. The impact of feed source (plant- and fish-based) was analyzed, as well as that of photovoltaic panels installed over the production area. Calculated emissions per kg fish live weight were 1.18 kg CO<SUB loc=\"post\">2eq</SUB>, 7.89e<SUP loc=\"post\">‑8</SUP> kg CFC<SUB loc=\"post\">11eq</SUB>, 0.00552 kg SO<SUB loc=\"post\">2eq,</SUB> and 0.0257 kg PO<SUB loc=\"post\">4eq</SUB>. Full covering of the production area with photovoltaic panels, compared to the current ∼40% coverage, was estimated to provide a reduction of 1.04 kg CO<SUB loc=\"post\">2eq,</SUB> resulting in emissions of 0.773 kg CO<SUB loc=\"post\">2eq</SUB> per kg fish live weight. Feeds containing 35% and 61.8% fishmeal were associated with lower emissions compared to 100% plant-based, with a reduction in GWP of 0.79 kg CO<SUB loc=\"post\">2eq</SUB> in the 61.8% fishmeal variant. Results showed that the use of photovoltaic panels can significantly reduce rainbow trout culture impact on the analyzed environmental impact categories. Feed containing fishmeal has a lower impact on the analyzed environmental impact categories. Alternatives such as insect meal and sustainable plant alternatives should be the focus of future research.",

We will report on our continued efforts towards a GEO implementation of our MODIS/VIIRS continuity cloud product (CLDPROP), the goal of which is to enable an internally consistent LEO/GEO cloud data record for NASAs Program of Record. We will also show results of initial 10-min processing of AHI during the CAMP2Ex mission which provides a unique dataset to validate key cloud properties and support the mission science. CLDPROP is based on the legacy MODIS cloud products suite that leverages heritage algorithmsMODIS cloud mask (MOD35), MODIS optical and microphysical properties product (MOD06), and the NOAA AWG Cloud Height Algorithm. In addition, the GEO sensors have additional capabilities expected to be useful for cloud retrievals (e.g., atmospheric absorption channels, temporal information). This presentation will focus on the challenges that need to be addressed to achieve a LEO/GEO cloud product that is consistent across all sensors leveraging CAMP2Ex to both validate the products and support the mission science objectives. These include: Pixel growth and view zenith angles that are geographically fixed for the GEO imagers can be expected to induce systematic biases in cloud masking and property retrievals relative to LEO products. Scattering angles that are correlated with time of day for GEO (see Figure 2) have additional sensitivities to the liquid and ice cloud radiative models used for optical property retrievals; these models can have distinct angular features (e.g., cloud bows, glories, etc.) that can cause biases relative to LEO products when concurrent LEO/GEO observations have differing view geometries.",

Due to significant cloud heterogeneity in the CAMP2Ex region (horizontal and vertical), the use of high spatial resolution and multiangle retrievals are necessary to evaluate retrieval fidelity. Here, we present initial result on Landsat 8 OLI cloud optical retrievals (~30 m spatial resolution) in the CAMP2Ex region as well as multiangle total radiance retrievals from the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) polarimeter (similar resolution as Landsat 8) that was flown on the NASA P3 aircraft during the campaign. Geosynchronous imagery and retrievals from AHI are being used to help understand the cloud temporal structure for the scenes under study. Both the Landsat and RSP retrievals make use of a cloud retrieval algorithm that is consistent with the current production suite of NASA cloud property products CLDPROP (cloud-top and optical properties) designed to bridge the imager observational records of EOS MODIS and SNPP/JPSS VIIRS, as well as the new generation GEO imagers.",

      "abstract": "An isolated, eroding pingo at the southern end of Parry Peninsula, N.W.T., Canada was first photographed in about 1910. The photograph allows examination of a century of landform change. Since 1910, the pingo crater pond has drained, the north side of the pingo has become well vegetated, the serrated crest has been smoothed, and the lake bottom has become colonised by willows and other vegetation. The height of the feature was over 100 ft (30 m) in 1910 and is now about 50 ft (15-17 m). The erosion of the pingo has probably been dominated by the strong southerly katabatic winds in the area, as the vegetation on the south side of the pingo is poorly developed in comparison with the north side. A secondary cause of erosion has been the numerous excavations by ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and foxes (Vulpes lagopus) on the slopes of the pingo. It is unusual to detect change of collapsed pingos near the western Arctic coast of Canada unless ground ice is exposed in the core or on the sides of the pingo. The increases since 1996 in height and cover of willows are the first record of such change from western Arctic Canada. Copyright",

      "abstract": "In this paper the atmospheric response to an open-ocean polynya in the Southern Ocean is studied by analyzing the results from an atmospheric and oceanic synoptic-scale resolving Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulation. While coarser-resolution versions of CESM generally do not produce open-ocean polynyas in the Southern Ocean, they do emerge and disappear on interannual time scales in the synoptic-scale simulation. This provides an ideal opportunity to study the polynya's impact on the overlying and surrounding atmosphere. This has been pursued here by investigating the seasonal cycle of differences of surface and air-column variables between polynya and nonpolynya years. The results indicate significant local impacts on turbulent heat fluxes, precipitation, cloud characteristics, and radiative fluxes. In particular, it is found that clouds over polynyas are optically thicker and higher than clouds over sea ice during nonpolynya years. Although the lower albedo of polynyas significantly increases the net shortwave absorption, the enhanced cloud brightness tempers this increase by almost 50%. Also, in this model, enhanced longwave radiation emitted from the warmer surface of polynyas is balanced by stronger downwelling fluxes from the thicker cloud deck. Impacts are found to be sensitive to the synoptic wind direction. The strongest regional impacts are found when northeasterly winds cross the polynya and interact with katabatic winds. Surface air pressure anomalies over the polynya are only found to be significant when cold, dry air masses strike over the polynya (i.e., in the case of southerly winds).",

      "abstract": "The energy balance of snow and ice surfaces in the dry Andes of Chile is dominated by solar radiation. Sublimation is important at high elevations and radiative cooling at night is favoured by the absence of clouds. Because of the scarcity of data in the region, the interaction between glaciers and atmosphere, and the related processes of energy exchange, has been studied only partially, despite the fact that they control melt and runoff generation. We intend to explore the variations in the interaction between climate and surface snow and ice associated with elevation, as a premise to distributed modelling of glacier ablation in the region. Two Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) were setup on Juncal Norte Glacier, central Chile, for a 3-month period from December 2008 to February 2009. The two locations are at 300 m difference in elevation, and differ also in terms of fetch available for the development of the katabatic wind. The surface energy balance is studied with an energy balance model including the subsurface heat conduction flux. Computations are driven by measurements of incoming and reflected shortwave radiation, wind speed and atmospheric temperature and humidity. The glacier surface temperature is simulated and used for computation of the longwave radiation and turbulent fluxes. These are simulated using the bulk aerodynamic method. We analyse meteorological forcing and the components of the energy balance and resulting ablation at the two stations. These show a very pronounced diurnal cycle, reflecting in the strong diurnal variability of runoff, mainly controlled by shortwave radiation. Net shortwave radiation and sensible heat fluxes are positive over the season, while net longwave radiation and latent heat fluxes are on average negative. We show that differential melt at the two AWSs sites (almost 10 mm w.e. per day on average) is caused by differences in albedo, resulting in a lower shortwave radiation flux at the uppermost station, and by differences in the sensible heat flux, associated with both lower air temperature and wind regime. Katabatic wind is evident at both stations, and together with air temperature governs the turbulent heat exchange. The heat flux into the snowpack is important at both sites.",

When additionally the snow cover is patchy, which is typically the case during much of the melt season, additional drivers modify the surface wind and boundary layer through local (positive or negative) buoyancy production. The resulting small-scale flow features are complex yet very important to correctly model surface exchange in such terrain. For example, the overall catchment melt behaviour is influenced by the fact that a patchy snow cover is very persistent due to de-coupling of the snow surface from the warmer air above. This presentation uses a combination of small-scale (m) meteorological simulations with ARPS and field measurements of snow distributions and turbulent fluxes to investigate the length scales of flow features such as katabatic winds and internal boundary layers. The flow features are interpreted in relationship to the length scales of the terrain and the patchy snow cover. The quantitative analysis is a useful basis to adapt parameterizations for larger scale models.",

It is shown how the different air masses and their evolution are easily identified when pressure and RASS-SODAR wind and temperature data are presented together. Likewise, periodic pressure fluctuations observed in the surface array of microbarometers reveal the existence of gravity wave motions whose propagation is better understood after locating the wave ducting layers with the help of RASS-SODAR average wind ant temperature profiles.",

      "abstract": "Due to the warming climate, significant retreat of glaciers in the Himalayan region is observed. Thus, it is crucial to understand whether and how the glaciers impact (feedback to) regional climate. Due to lack of observational data, most processes with glaciers are however not well documented. For instance, convergence takes place when summertime upslope flows of warm and moist air masses meet cool and dry katabatic winds over a glacier slope, which may induce local convections and precipitations. This work intends to test this hypothesis according to an experiment conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model focusing on the Himalayan region. Three cases are designed for the experiment: a) a normal run as the control case; b) a sensitive run with land use ice/snow replaced by bare ground tundra and the maximum snow albedo set to 0.25; and c) a sensitive run with land use ice/snow replaced by bare ground tundra and no new snowing. According to differences between the control case and both the two sensitive cases, here we found that glaciers overall leads to less precipitation over glacier-covered areas and north of the Himalayas, which can be attributed to the suppressing of cooling glacier surfaces to upslope moist flows. By contrast, a zone of extra more precipitation (that can be up to 200 mm for JJA) is clearly found over the south slope of the Himalayas at elevation of 4-5 km where it meets the glacier terminus, accompanied with the convergence of upslope air masses and katabatic winds. Case b) reflects a smaller such effect when compared to case c), possibly because it takes a portion of energy for ice/snow melting. When it comes to impacts on water vapor transport, glaciers will result approximately 2% less moisture flowing into the Tibetan Plateau.",

Most of the upgrades made resulted from attention paid to less than satisfactory performance noted in several Eta results, and identification of the reasons for the problem. Others came from simple expectation that including a feature that is physically justified but is missing in the code should help. The most notable of the upgrades are the introduction of the so-called sloping steps, or discretized shaved cells topography; piecewise-linear finite-volume vertical advection of dynamic variables; vapor and hydrometeor loading in the hydrostatic equation, and changes aimed at refining the convection schemes available in the Eta. Several other modifications have to do with the calculation of exchange coefficients, conservation in the vertical diffusion, and diagnostic calculation of 10-m winds. Several examples showing improved performance resulting from the dynamics changes are given. One includes a case of unrealistically low temperatures in several mountain basins generated by a centered vertical advection difference scheme's unphysical advection from below ground, removed by its replacement with a finite-volume scheme. Another is that of increased katabatic winds in the Terra Nova Bay Antarctica region. Successful forecast of the severe downslope zonda wind case in the lee of the highest peaks of the Andes is also shown, and some of the recent successful verification results of the use of the upgraded model are pointed out. The code is used at numerous places, and along with setup information it is available for outside users at the CPTEC Eta web site given above.",

Here we characterize meltwater iron sources in a heavily glaciated western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) fjord. Using dissolved and particulate ratios of manganese to iron in meltwaters, porewaters, and seawater, we show that surface glacial melt and subglacial plumes contribute to the seasonal cycle of iron and manganese within a fjord still relatively unaffected by climate-change-induced glacial retreat. Organic ligands derived from the phytoplankton bloom and the glaciers bind dissolved iron and facilitate the solubilization of particulate iron downstream. Using a numerical model, we show that buoyant plumes generated by outflow from the subglacial hydrologic system, enriched in labile particulate trace metals derived from a chemically modified crustal source, can supply iron to the fjord euphotic zone through vertical mixing. We also show that prolonged katabatic wind events enhance export of meltwater out of the fjord. Thus, we identify an important atmosphere-ice-ocean coupling intimately tied to coastal iron biogeochemistry and primary productivity along the WAP.",

Windward sides of the islands generally showed the time of maximum for frequency or amount to be before sunrise while the leeward sides generally revealed the primary maximum in the afternoon. We conducted the analyses for El Niño years and La Niña years and found the diurnal patterns in rainfall to be unaffected by this Pacific-area oscillation. The results are consistent with others who have argued, based on work on the island of Hawaii, that anabatic and katabatic wind flows are responsible for the observed diurnal rainfall patterns. A semi-diurnal cycle with two maxima and two minima appears to be important in the summer season in the leeward locations. Our results show that processes and patterns described for the island of Hawaii are found throughout the larger islands of the Hawaii chain.",

One such process, drifting and blowing snow, has only been considered in a very simplified way in current meteorological and climatological models. To address this problem, the CRYOWRF model has been developed, a coupled model between the meteorological Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and the snow model SNOWPACK, augmented by a detailed treatment of drifting and blowing snow. Applying CRYOWRF to the SMB of Antarctica, we find that the model reproduces measurements of SMB with similar errors than current models. Drifting and blowing snow and its sublimation play a particularly important role, especially in regions of strong katabatic winds. The CRYOWRF simulations are also in line with satellite estimates of blowing snow frequency. There is a need to further consolidate results by simulations with a higher grid resolution and by including more measurements of SMB contributions from snow fall to transport and sublimation.",

The stations are classified into three groups according to their location (high plateau, intermediate plateau, or coastal region), each having distinct annual temperature and wind speed regimes. These classifications also correspond well to the stations' slopes. Change in surface air temperature along the slope with respect to height was smaller than -1°C/100 m between the high plateau and the intermediate plateau stations. The wind directions did not follow Ball's model, which suggests the importance of the gradient of surface potential air temperature along the slope on the wind regime. A scale analysis showed the condition in which the gradient of surface potential air temperature along the slope should not be considered negligible when considering the total pressure gradient force. This condition in turn indicates that the entrainment of momentum across the top of the katabatic wind layer is also important.",

      "abstract": "To evaluate optimal management strategies which reduce fossil-fuel carbon emissions, an idealized gross returns objective function was developed for the production of irrigated maize with the inclusion of a disincetive carbon-taxing term. The gross returns objective function is multivariant and optimized through a gradient search procedure. Carbon emissions emanating from maize production stem from the utilization of fossil-fuel energy on the farm as well as the utilized to manufacture many of the production inputs (i.e. fertilizers and pesticides). Particular emphasis was placed on determining fertilizer (nitrogen) and irrigation (furrow) management strategies which reduced fossil-fuel carbon emissions at a minimum reduction in gross returns. Total emissions and optimal maize yield were reduced slightly at high carbon-taxing rates, whereas gross returns decreased considerably. Decreases in optimal maize yield were a consequence of reducing applied water and nitrogen fertilizer, both of which are energy-intensive production inputs. The most effective means of reducing fossil-fuel carbon emissions associated with maize production at minimum reductions in gross returns is increasing the price of nitrogen fertilizer rather than levying a carbon tax.",

At the same time, relativistic effect are strongest in the nuclear region, where the description of electrons through linear combination of atomic orbitals becomes more challenging. Furthermore, the choice of basis sets for heavier elements is limited compared to lighter elements where precise basis sets are available. Thanks to the framework of multiresolution analysis, multiwavelets provide an appealing alternative to overcome this challenge: they lead to robust error control and adaptive algorithms that automatically refine the basis set description until the desired precision is reached. This allows to achieve a proper description of the nuclear region. In this work we extended the Multiwavelet-based code MRChem to the scalar zero-order regular approximation (ZORA) framework. We validated our implementation comparing the total energies for a small set of elements and molecules. To confirm the validity of our implementation, we compared both against a radial numerical code for atoms and the plane-wave based code exciting.",

However, little is known about the ability of models to reliably represent the microphysical processes governing the precipitation. This study makes use of recent ground-based precipitation measurements at Dumont d'Urville station in Adélie Land to evaluate the representation of the precipitation microphysics in the Polar version of the Weather Research Forecast (Polar WRF) atmospheric model. During two summertime snowfall events, high-resolution simulations are compared to measurements from an X-band polarimetric radar and from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). A radar simulator and a \"MASC\" simulator in Polar WRF make it possible to compare similar observed and simulated variables. Radiosoundings and surface-meteorological observations were used to assess the representation of the regional dynamics in the model. Five different microphysical parameterizations are tested. The simulated temperature, wind, and humidity fields are in good agreement with the observations. However, the amount of simulated surface precipitation shows large discrepancies with respect to observations, and it strongly differs between the simulations themselves, evidencing the critical role of the microphysics. The inspection of vertical profiles of reflectivity and mixing ratios revealed that the representation of the sublimation process by the low-level dry katabatic winds strongly influences the actual amount of precipitation at the ground surface. By comparing the simulated radar signal as well as MASC and model particle size distributions, it is also possible to identify the microphysical processes involved and to pinpoint shortcomings within the tested parameterizations.",

      "abstract": "Antarctica is noted for strong and persistent winds in the lower atmosphere. The wind directions are controlled by the underlying ice terrain and are deflected in general 20°-50° to the left of the fall line. The Antarctic surface wind regime is thought to be the result of the dual influences of diabatic cooling of the terrain, responsible for the infamous katabatic winds, and the synoptic pressure gradient force in the free atmosphere. The relative importance of pressure gradients associated with katabatic and synoptic processes in forcing the wintertime Antarctic boundary layer winds is evaluated using output from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) global reanalysis program for June, July, and August of 1997. Both katabatic and synoptic forces are found to be significant in shaping the near-surface winter winds over the Antarctic ice slopes. Analyses show that the synoptic force is influenced by the underlying ice terrain such that the net force over Antarctica is directed primarily downslope. This result reflects the adjustment of the large-scale ambient pressure gradient to the continental orography. The synoptic force over Antarctica thus differs significantly in both magnitude and direction from that found over the oceanic regions to the north. The adjustment of the synoptic force over the ice sheets enable even the nonwinter Antarctic winds to attain a high directional constancy and resemble a gravity-driven flow. This process also suggests that direction alone is insufficient in classifying Antarctic flows as katabatic.",

Changes in transiting consolidated ice volume are shown to dominate the evolution and variation of the polynya during a typical polynya shrinking event that occurred between 19 June to 03 July, 2013, rather than katabatic winds or air temperature, which are commonly assumed to be the main drivers. Over the cold seasons from 2013 to 2020, the Terra Nova Bay Polynya area is highly correlated to the transiting consolidated ice volume. We demonstrate that thick transiting ice limits the polynya area by blocking the newly-formed sea ice from leaving.",

Surface mass ablation dominates over persistent wind-scour zones as near-surface katabatic winds accelerate over locally steeper ice surface topography, and sublimate and redistribute snow. Here we quantify ablation rates and downwind redeposition of snow over wind-scour zones in the upper Recovery Ice Stream catchment. Airborne radio echo-soundings show a gradual ablation of ~16-18 m of firn, corresponding to ~200 years of accumulation, over these zones and ablation rates of ~54 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> a<SUP>-1</SUP> (54 mm water equivalent a<SUP>-1</SUP>). We conclude that mass loss is dominated by sublimation and mass is transported downwind as water vapor, because snow redeposition downslope of the wind-scour zones constitutes only a small fraction (&lt;10%) of the cumulative mass loss.",

Using the DMS and reflectivity of ATM L1B, leads are detected to define local sea level height. The total freeboard is then obtained and converted to ice thickness. The estimated mean sea-ice thickness values are found to be in the 0.48-0.99 m range. Along the N-S track, sea ice was thinner southward rather than northward of the fluxgate, resulting in two peaks of modal thickness: 0.35 m (south) and 0.7 m (north). This supports that new ice produced in coastal polynyas is transported northward by katabatic winds off the ice-shelf. The lowest (2%) elevation method used for freeboard retrieval for ICESat is also tested for ATM data. It is found that the lowest elevation method tends to overestimate freeboard, but mean values are less affected than mode values. Using mean thickness values of ICESat and ATM along the 'fluxgate', separating the shelf from the deep ocean, the exported ice volume at this 'fluxgate' is found to be higher during the ICESat years (2003-2008) than during the IceBridge year (2013).",

One employed the current land-use distribution, while the other two corresponded to an increase of the densely urbanized area by 12.5% (test 1) and 37.5% (test 2), respectively. Apart from the hypothetically urbanized areas, where average surface wind speed reductions of 8% and 18% were obtained for test 1 and test 2, respectively, the rest of the domain was not significantly affected by hypothetical urbanization. The differences between the wind vectors for the predicted current state and the hypothetical state were more pronounced and found at higher altitudes during the night compared to daytime values. For all three simulations the same diurnal variation of the depth of anabatic/katabatic wind flow generated on south-facing slopes of 1 km high mountain Medvednica was obtained. During the night the depth of well-developed katabatic flow was about 370 m, while during the day the depth of anabatic flow grew from about 550 m in the late morning up to about 1140 m in the late afternoon.",

Some inter-related factors possibly contributing to the modern temperature variability are differences in sensible heat from warm or cold air masses, differences in wind strength and source region, differences in temperature inversion strength and differences in cloudiness. Our preliminary data are compatible with spatially variable katabatic winds that could control the winter temperature inversion strength to provide a large part of the signal. This has implications for paleoclimate studies.(1) Variations of the stable isotopes δ18O and δD from ice cores are a proxy for paleotemperature. The isotope thermometer is calibrated by comparing local isotope ratios with corresponding measured temperatures. In order to derive a useful isotope-temperature calibration, we must understand the processes that control the modern spatial variability of temperature. (2) In order to quantify past changes in local climate, we must understand processes that influence local spatial variability. If those processes differed in the past, ice-core climate reconstruction would be affected in two ways: through alteration of the geochemical record and through alteration of deep ice and firn temperatures.",

The flights were conducted on the same day but under different wind conditions: a morning flight with a 10-knot (18 km h<SUP>‑1</SUP>) katabatic wind blowing perpendicular to the direction of helicopter travel, and an afternoon flight with virtually no wind. Background noise levels recorded in the morning before the helicopter flight were significantly higher than in the afternoon, but these differences were not detectable when the helicopter was overhead. There were also no significant differences in the way chicks responded to helicopters between the morning and afternoon flight. All chicks became more vigilant when the helicopter approached and 69% either walked or ran, generally moving less than 10 m toward other chicks (i.e. not scattering). Most chicks (83%) displayed flipper-flapping, probably indicating nervous apprehension. This behaviour was seldom displayed in the absence of disturbance. Although all effects were relatively transitory, the results support the introduction of a more conservative guideline of 1500 m (5000 ft) minimum overflight altitude for helicopter operations around breeding localities of this species.",

Field observations were performed in summer 2003 at Werenskiold glacier, southwest Spitsbergen. In both strains, temperature and light were found to affect the shape and size of the cells, and in R. nivale also the number of cells in filament, probably by modifying growth and division rates.

The model assumes that azimuth anisotropy in surface roughness at scales of 3-300 m is the primary mechanism driving the modulation. To evaluate the contribution of azimuth anisotropy in surface roughness to the radar backscatter, the model is compared to models based on isotropic surface roughness. The models are inverted to estimate snow surface properties using σ° measurements from the C-band European Remote-sensing Satellite advanced microwave instrument in scatterometer mode. Results indicate that the largest mesoscale rms surface slopes are found in the lower portions of the dry snow zone. Estimates of the preferential direction in surface roughness are highly correlated with katabatic wind fields over Greenland, which is consistent with wind-formed sastrugi as the dominant mechanism causing azimuth modulation of σ°. The maximum improvement of the azimuth modulation surface model compared to its isotropic counterparts occurs in the lower regions of the dry snow zone where the azimuth variability of σ° is the largest. In regions with azimuth modulation over 1 dB, the mean root-mean-square error estimate of the azimuth-dependent surface scattering model is 0.46 dB compared with 0.70 dB for similar models using isotropic roughness.",

This cove is set apart from the open sea by a 12- to 15-m deep sill. Samplings were carried out over 20 days in summer 1997/1998 in the water column, in the sediment and in material collected from the sea-bottom interface by means of a sediment trap. Benthic communities were studied mainly using ROV video tapes. The complex and peculiar interactions between physical, chemical and biological processes, both in the water column and in the sediments, were tightly linked to a katabatic wind pattern, which is the main constraint in water mass circulation. A clear evolution in organic matter distribution and composition was observed. These processes led to a high build-up of materials in the sediments in the deepest part of the cove, which favoured deposit-feeding species and largely contributed to the organic enrichment of the sediments.",

These have been first described and named megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, spectroscopic data and radar soundings, acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. They have similarities with Antarctic megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Based on this analogy, we are currently developing a model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of ice sheets. In Antarctica the accumulation processes on megadunes fields is generally attributed to the wind-blown snow transport while on sedimentation waves of the North Polar Cap of Mars the accumulation seems to be dominated by sublimation/condensation processes at the surface. The model is designed to explore the implication of the water vapor mass transfer and heat transfer on the development of sedimentation waves both on Mars and Earth.",

      "abstract": "A large number of quantities have to be measured and processed to determine the atmospheric-state variables, which are the actual measurands, from aircraft-based measurements. A great part of the dependencies between these quantities depends on the aerodynamic state of the aircraft. Aircraft-based meteorological measurements, hence, require in-flight calibration. Most operators of research aircraft perform some kind of calibration, but the schemes used and the degree they are documented greatly vary. The flight maneuvers and calculation methods required, however, are published in a number of partly overlapping and partly contradictory publications. Some methods are only presented as a minor issue in publications mainly focused on atmospheric processes and are therefore hard to find. For an aircraft user, it is hence challenging to either perform or verify a calibration because of missing comprehensive guidance. This lack was stated on occasion of the in-flight calibration of the German research aircraft Polar5 carried out for the field experiment Investigation of Katabatic Winds and Polynyas during Summer (IKAPOS). In the present paper, a comprehensive review of the existing literature on this field and a practical guide to the wind calibration of a research aircraft to be used for turbulent flux measurements are given.",

Measurements were performed using the eddy-correlation method at a remote site during the XXII Italian expedition of the National Research Program in Antarctica (PNRA) in 2006. The measurement system was based on a condensation particle counter (CPC) able to measure particles down to 9 nm in diameter with a 50% efficiency and a Differential Mobility Particle Sizer for evaluating particle size distributions from 11 to 521 nm diameter in 39 channels. A method based on postprocessing with digital filters was developed to take into account the effect of the slow time response of the CPC. The average number concentration was 1338 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> (median, 978 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>; interquartile range, 435-1854 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). Higher concentrations were observed at low wind velocities. Results gave an average deposition velocity of 0.47 mm/s (median, 0.19 mm/s; interquartile range, -0.21 -0.88 mm/s). Deposition increased with the friction velocity and was on average 0.86 mm/s during katabatic wind characterized by velocities higher than 4 m/s. Observed size distributions generally presented two distinct modes, the first at approximately 15-20 nm and the second (representing on average 70% of the total particles) at 60-70 nm. Under strong-wind conditions, the second mode dominated the average size distribution.",

We present detailed subsurface maps for these features and offer explanation for genesis of the deposit's morphologic asymmetry, expressed in different erosional characteristics between 0°E-180°E and 180°E-360°E. Additionally, this work revealed a depression in the basal unit that may have provided a site for spiral trough initiation. Interpretations of the findings suggest that antecedent BU topography has a marked impact on modern morphology and that aeolian forces have been the dominant driver of polar deposit accumulation since at least the end of rupes unit emplacement. We find no results requiring explanation beyond common Martian surface processes, including aeolian erosion and impact armoring. To add to the detailed morphologic study of the BU, we mapped the variability of the BU radar reflection character. Combining generalized katabatic wind flow with the radar mapping results suggests that rupes unit material sourced the younger cavi. We present clear evidence that, while compositionally distinct from the overlying layered deposits, the BU and its morphology are intimately linked to the morphology of the north polar layered deposits. Combining geologic evidence with paleoclimate modeling, the deposits contain evidence for a long history of aeolian emplacement and modification.",

      "abstract": "As part of the USJGOFS-AESOPS program, we deployed an array of moored sediment traps and determined the composition and vertical flux of particulate matter through the water column of the continental shelf environment of the Ross Sea. We deployed two moorings, with two traps each. One mooring was located in the southcentral Ross Sea along the line of AESOPS process studies; the other mooring was located in the northcentral Ross Sea. The flux in the southern Ross Sea was generally double that in the north, and there was a significant increase in flux into the deep traps indicating horizontal transport and possible focusing of particulate matter. The particles are primarily biogenic although lithogenic contributions can increase to over 30% of the flux in the near-bottom trap nearer to the ice shelf. The fluxes collected by the traps were generally low but within the range of previous observations. Several unique observations stand out from these data: (1) The export of organic matter to 200 m during the spring and summer was extremely low, consistent with observations that the ongoing phytoplankton bloom was being stored or recycled in the upper-water column; (2) A major pulse of biogenic silica export occurred in the fall, just as ice was reforming. The correlation of this event with lithogenous particles, excess Fe, and with the early breakout of katabatic winds suggests that this event might be related to Fe fertilization of diatom production and export; (3) The largest flux of organic matter during 1996-1997 was carried by the pteropod Limacina helicina and was observed at both moorings under the ice in the late fall, just after the diatom pulse. Although it is difficult to estimate the proportion of these organisms that were swimmers contaminating the flux, we believe that a significant fraction settled into the traps and may represent the die-out of this herbivore population after the suspended POM concentration had dropped to very low levels. Fluxes to the upper traps were much lower than estimates of export flux made by other methods during synoptic ship studies. These differences are discussed and the fluxes are compared with preliminary data from the ROAVERRS trap program, which was simultaneously deployed in the Ross Sea.",

The measurements were carried out in a valley of Heimefrontfjella, Dronning Maud Land, during a 2 month field season in the austral summer of 1992-93. A simple model is used to evaluate the surface-energy balance from measured meteorological quantities. The large differences in the surface-energy-balance values between snow and blue ice are mainly caused by differences inalbedo, surface roughness, thermal conductivity and short-wave radiation extinction coefficient. Taking into account uncertainties in the calculations, it appears that the calculated sublimation rates over ice and snow do not differ much.Furthermore, typical circulation patterns are described. The large continental-scale katabatic flow is forced by radiative cooling of the surface (night-time) and the mesoscale horizontal temperature gradient (daytime). The latter penetrates to the surface due to enhanced mixing in an unstable stratified boundary layer. At night, shallow katabatic layers form along local fall lines. On some occasions the large-scale katabatic winds decrease through the presence of a high-pressure system in the weddell Sea and a local circulation can develop inside the valley.",

      "abstract": "Air temperature is a key control in the exchange of energy fluxes at the glacier-atmosphere interface and is also the main input variable in many of the melt models currently used to predict glacier melt across a variety of scales, be these energy balance or temperature-index type of models. The commonly used approach to derive distributed temperature inputs is extrapolation from point measurements with a Lapse Rate (LR) that is often assumed to be constant in time and uniform in space. In this work, temperature data from three Automatic Weather Stations and twelve Temperature Loggers are used to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of temperature over a glacier, its main atmospheric controls, the suitability of extrapolation techniques and their effect on melt modelling. We use data collected on Juncal Norte Glacier, central Chile, during one ablation season. We examine temporal and spatial variability in LRs, together with alternative statistical interpolation methods. Our main result is that the main control over the glacier thermal regime is the development of a katabatic boundary layer (KBL). Katabatic wind occurs at night and in the morning and is eroded in the afternoon. LRs reveal strong diurnal variability, with steeper LRs during the day when the katabatic wind weakens and shallower LRs during the night and morning. We suggest that temporally variable LRs should be used to account for the observed change. They tend to be steeper than equivalent constant LRs, and therefore result in a reduction in simulated melt compared to use of constant LRs. In addition to the temporal variability, the temperature-elevation relationship varies also in space. Differences are evident between local LRs and including such variability in melt modelling affects melt simulations. The LR used for the upper glacier is a key control on the area contributing to melt, and thus on total melt. Extrapolation methods based on the spatial variability of the observations after removal of the elevation trend, such as Inverse Distance Weighting or Kriging, do not seem necessary for simulations of gridded temperature data over a glacier.",

We presently analyse some results of a campaign led in the French Alps in 2019 (Charrondière et al. 2022) in order to study katabatic flows over a steep snowy alpine slope of about 30°, that develop during winter anticyclonic conditions. In the topographic and meteorological configuration of the experiment, these downslope flows have a jet shape, with a maximum wind speed height zj very close to the surface, at about 30 cm height.A 3D pitot type sensor allowed measurements of wind speed down to 3 cm height above the surface, at a high sampling frequency of 1250 Hz. Sonic anemometers placed on a fixed bracket allowed to capture for the first time the 3D velocity of the katabatic flows (f=20 Hz) in the topographic coordinate system, whereas previous studies are in the streamline coordinate system. We focus mainly on the inner region of the jet, below zj. The turbulent momentum flux is decreasing with height, and its variation can be derived from a simplification of the along-slope momentum equation where the gravity term balances the turbulent momentum flux gradient to first order, as shown in Denby and Smeets (2000).We compare the inner region of the jet with a neutral turbulent boundary layer in terms of wind speed profile, and derive a correction of the classical log-law that considers the gravity effect on the along-slope velocity. This correction is different from the well-known Monin-Obukhov stability correction, which is negligible for the present flow because of relative low turbulent sensible heat fluxes compared to turbulent momentum fluxes.We also show that the slope-normal velocity is negative and as high as 10-15% of the maximum wind speed in the inner region of the jet. The slope-normal momentum equation behavior in this region of the jet is consistent with the observations and confirms that a gravity source term directs the flow to the ground. We finally analyze the impact of gravity on the temperature equation: the mean temperature profile and the turbulent sensible heat flux are also modified by it. All these modifications have implications on the turbulent Prandtl number, which behaves differently from what we expect on a neutral turbulent boundary layer cooled at the surface.Charrondière, C., Brun, C., Cohard, JM. et al.

      "abstract": "Under the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project, a 3.5-year record of atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) has been gathered at Dumont d'Urville (DDU, 66°40' S, 140°01' E, 43 m above sea level) on the East Antarctic coast. Additionally, surface snow samples were collected in February 2009 during a traverse between Concordia Station located on the East Antarctic plateau and DDU. The record of atmospheric Hg(0) at DDU reveals particularities that are not seen at other coastal sites: a gradual decrease of concentrations over the course of winter, and a daily maximum concentration around midday in summer. Additionally, total mercury concentrations in surface snow samples were particularly elevated near DDU (up to 194.4 ng L<SUP>-1</SUP>) as compared to measurements at other coastal Antarctic sites. These differences can be explained by the more frequent arrival of inland air masses at DDU than at other coastal sites. This confirms the influence of processes observed on the Antarctic plateau on the cycle of atmospheric mercury at a continental scale, especially in areas subject to recurrent katabatic winds. DDU is also influenced by oceanic air masses and our data suggest that the ocean plays a dual role on Hg(0) concentrations. The open ocean may represent a source of atmospheric Hg(0) in summer whereas the sea-ice surface may provide reactive halogens in spring that can oxidize Hg(0). This paper also discusses implications for coastal Antarctic ecosystems and for the cycle of atmospheric mercury in high southern latitudes.",

      "abstract": "Mars' seasonal caps are characterized during Mars years 26 and 27 (April 2002 to January 2006) using data acquired by the 2001 Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer. Time-dependent maps of the column abundance of seasonal CO<SUB>2</SUB> surface ice poleward of 60° latitude in both hemispheres are determined from spatially deconvolved, epithermal neutron counting data. Sources of systematic error are analyzed, including spatial blurring by the spectrometer's broad footprint and the seasonal variations in the abundance of noncondensable gas at high southern latitudes, which are found to be consistent with results reported by Sprague et al. (2004, 2007). Corrections for spatial blurring are found to be important during the recession, when the column abundance of seasonal CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice has the largest latitude gradient. The measured distribution and inventory of seasonal CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice is compared to simulations by a general circulation model (GCM) calibrated using Viking lander pressure data, cap edge functions determined by thermal emission spectroscopy, and other nuclear spectroscopy data sets. On the basis of the amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> cycled through the caps during years 26 and 27, the gross polar energy balance has not changed significantly since Viking. The distribution of seasonal CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice is longitudinally asymmetric: in the north, deposition rates of CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice are elevated in Acidalia, which is exposed to katabatic winds from Chasma Borealis; in the south, CO<SUB>2</SUB> deposition is highest near the residual cap. During southern recession, CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice is present longer than calculated by the GCM, which has implications for the local polar energy balance.",

      "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover spent a full martian year exploring the phyllosilicate-bearing Glen Torridon trough on the flank of Aeolis Mons in Gale crater, enabling in-depth assessment of aeolian processes. MSL encountered erosional and depositional features recording a long aeolian history. The trough has served as a long-term conduit for sand transport, probably involving many cycles of sand accumulation and deflation. Rock abrasion textures indicate sand-driving winds blowing W-SW (opposite of abrasion textures on the Greenheugh Pediment above the trough floor). Indurated megaripple surfaces with 2-5 mm grains contrast with seasonally active ripples having finer maximum grain sizes, indicating more vigorous saltation in the past. Active ripples display a broad continuum of wavelengths, as well as coarser grains at crests than troughs, consistent with origins as impact ripples. Orientations of a wind streak extending from a large ripple field, and sandy wind tails behind obstacles, indicate sand is driven W-SW in the current era, approximately along the trough axis. Erosion of drill tailings piles was strongly seasonal, enhanced during late spring and early summer (perihelion). Climate modeling suggests W-SW sand transport can be attributed to seasonal enhancement of nighttime regional winds entering Gale crater from the N, combined with local katabatic winds flowing down the slopes of Aeolis Mons. However, it is unclear whether sand transport at Glen Torridon is primarily from these wind components combining and acting simultaneously, or occurring in serial at different times of night; field evidence supports both possibilities.",

Here, we use a regional climate model with a newly developed drifting snow scheme to show that accounting for drifting snow notably alters the spatial distribution, vertical structure and radiative effect of clouds over Antarctica. Overall, we find that accounting for drifting snow leads to a greater cloud cover providing an increase of +2.74 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP> in the surface radiative energy budget. Additionally, a comparison with 20 weather stations reveals a 2.17 Wm<SUP>-2</SUP> improvement in representing the radiative energy fluxes.

It most certainly results from more frequent negative phases of the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) favoring warmer conditions over the GrIS. Anomalies in sea ice cover (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) don't seem to be involved in these recent GrIS melt records. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a set of sensitivity experiments using different SIC and SST has been achieved to estimate the impact of these variables on the GrIS surface mass balance (SMB) and katabatic winds strength over 2007-2012. These sensitivity tests consist of single or coupled fluctuations of SST and SIC, using the regional climate model MAR forced by the ERA-INTERIM reanalysis. Comparisons of these sensitivity experiments to the reference one show that changes in SST and SIC surrounding Greenland have not a direct impact on the GrIS SMB due to the katabatic winds. Indeed, continental katabatic winds are strong enough to prevent the synoptic oceanic wind, influenced by SIC and SST variability, from penetrating into the GrIS. However, anomalies in SST and SIC could have affected the general circulation over Greenland.",

      "abstract": "Surface snow accumulation is the primary mass input to the Antarctic ice sheets. As the dominant term among various components of surface snow accumulation (precipitation, sublimation/deposition, and snow drift), precipitation is of particular importance in helping to assess the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets and their contribution to global sea level change.The Polar MM5, a mesoscale atmospheric model based on the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University NCAR Mesoscale Model, has been run for the period of July 1996 through June 1999 to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic precipitation. Drift snow effects on the redistribution of surface snow over Antarctica are also assessed with surface wind fields from Polar MM5 in this study. It is found that areas with large drift snow transport convergence and divergence are located around escarpment areas where there is considerable katabatic wind acceleration. It is also found that the drift snow transport generally diverges over most areas of East and West Antarctica with relatively small values.The use of the dynamic retrieval method (DRM) to calculate precipitation has been developed and verified for the Greenland ice sheet. The DRM is also applied to retrieve the precipitation over Antarctica from 1979 to 1999 in this study. Most major features in the spatial distribution of Antarctic accumulation are well captured by the DRM results. In comparison with predicted precipitation amounts from atmospheric analyses and reanalyses, DRM calculations capture more mesoscale features of the precipitation distribution over Antarctica. A significant upward trend of +1.3 to +1.7 mm yr<SUP>-2</SUP> for 1979 99 is found from DRM and forecast precipitation amounts for Antarctica that is consistent with results reported by other investigators and indicates that an additional 0.05 mm yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is being extracted from the global ocean and locked up in the Antarctic ice sheets. While there is good agreement in this trend among all of the datasets, the interannual variability about the trend on the continental scale is not well captured. However, on the subcontinental scale, the interannual variability about the trend is well resolved for sectors in West Antarctica and the South Atlantic. It is also noted that the precipitation trend is weakly downward over much of the continent.",

To test this hypothesis, we explore six years of distributed meteorological data on a small Swiss glacier in the period 2001-2022. Large glacier fragmentation has occurred since 2001 (-35% area change up to 2022) coinciding with notable frontal retreat, an observed switch from down-glacier katabatic to up-glacier valley winds and an increased sensitivity (ratio) of on-glacier to off-glacier temperature. As the glacier ceases to develop density-driven katabatic winds, sensible heat fluxes on the glacier are increasingly determined by the conditions occurring outside the boundary layer of the glacier, sealing the glacier's demise as the climate continues to warm and experience an increased frequency of extreme summers.",

The Cross-platform HIgh resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system addresses the latter aspect of the inter-sensor continuity problem for cloud property retrievals by removing retrieval methodology and implementation as a source of inconsistency when applied to instruments that share common measurement capabilities. <P />Transferring an existing retrieval algorithm to a new sensor oftentimes is a nontrivial task, as it is common for an algorithm code to be tightly coupled to the sensor for which it was developed. By creating a clear division between the science algorithm and the instrument I/O codes, CHIMAERA allows easy migration of science algorithms to different sensors. CHIMAERA is built from C and FORTRAN source code, and can operate in a variety of environments ranging from a personal laptop to a high-performance computing environment for near real-time satellite data production. It is highly adaptable, low-maintenance and allows for easy expansion such that adding new instruments into the system requires only instrument-specific I/O and provision of any external lookup tables specific to the instrument's spectral characteristics. <P />CHIMAERA currently officially supports 13 spaceborne and airborne atmospheric imagers from a single code base, and has been in use since 2007. This paper describes the engineering aspects of CHIMAERA and a few examples from its many current applications are briefly discussed.",

All these causes result in overheating which can lead to an eventual thermal runaway which again could lead to a severe fire and explosion. We report on changes in thermal stability due to different ageing mechanisms in abstract Lian (#176439) and in Lian [4].

This paper assesses the risk of contracting COVID-19 through exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via cash acting as a fomite in payment transactions. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted for a scenario assuming an infectious person at the onset of symptoms, when virion concentrations in coughed droplets are at their highest. This person then contaminates a banknote by coughing on it and immediately hands it over to another person, who might then be infected by transferring the virions with a finger from the contaminated banknote to a facial mucous membrane. The scenario considered transfer efficiency of virions on the banknote to fingertips when droplets were still wet and after having dried up and subsequently being touched by finger printing or rubbing the object. Accounting for the likelihood of the scenario to occur by considering (1) a local prevalence of 100 COVID-19 cases/100,000 persons, (2) a maximum of about one-fifth of infected persons transmit high virus loads, and (3) the numbers of cash transactions/person/day, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions was estimated to be much lower than once per 39,000 days (107 years) for a single person. In the general populace, there will be a maximum of 2.6 expected cases/100,000 persons/day. The risk for a cashier at an average point of sale was estimated to be much less than once per 430 working days (21 months). The depicted scenario is a rare event, therefore, for a single person, the risk of contracting COVID-19 via person-to-person cash transactions is very low. At a point of sale, the risk to the cashier proportionally increases but it is still low.",

Recent improvements in lithography have allowed for the patterning of periodic lattice structures with lattice constants of 40 nm or less. While the Hofstadter fractal energy spectrum has been studied previously through the Moire interference pattern between graphene and hBN, it has not been observed in such a tunable environment. Our multi-gate structure allows us to independently set carrier density and lattice strength, allowing us to investigate the competition between multiple allowed states associated with different lattices in our 2DEG. By comparing different lattice geometries we will also present a richer understanding of how lattice symmetry alters the Hofstadter energy spectrum.",

By analysing the relationship of water temperature to hydrological characteristics, air temperature, solar exposure, and precipitation, this study predicted temperature dynamics of five temperate cold-water aquaculture facilities under four projected climate change scenarios. Air temperature was found to be directly associated with facility site water temperature, and based on rational assumptions, two of the five facilities were predicted to face critical warming by mid-century. Extreme precipitation events induced acute short-term increases in water temperature of up to 5 °C. Significantly lower warming, roughly equal to the projected climate change–induced increase, was seen with artificial shading lowering temperature by 1 °C. Complementary niche modelling revealed that 37–77 % of current cold-water facilities will likely incur suboptimal climate conditions by the end of the century. Shading of raceways, more efficient water use, and disease management are proposed as key actions to preserve cold-water aquaculture.",

In the Arctic, the COPs derived from passive remote sensing such as from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are difficult to obtain with adequate accuracy owing mainly to insufficient knowledge about the snow/ice surface, but also because of the low solar zenith angle. This study aims to validate COPs derived from passive remote sensing in the Arctic by using aircraft measurements collected during two field campaigns based in Fairbanks, Alaska. During both experiments, ARCTAS (Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites) and ARISE (Arctic Radiation-IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment), the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) measured upwelling and downwelling shortwave spectral irradiances, which can be used to derive surface and cloud albedo, as well as the irradiance transmitted by clouds. We assess the variability of the Arctic sea ice/snow surfaces albedo through these aircraft measurements and incorporate this variability into cloud retrievals for SSFR. We then compare COPs as derived from SSFR and MODIS for all suitable aircraft underpasses of the satellites. Finally, the sensitivities of the COPs to surface albedo and solar zenith angle are investigated.",

Within the framework of the operational air pollution forecasts for East Asia, being offered by the EU project PANDA, this study aims to evaluate the EMEP/MSC-W CTM in simulating high pollution events over Asian cities. This work is the first attempt to use this CTM with a fine horizontal resolution (0.1°×0.1°) over Asia and to simulate the pollution over urban regions. The main part of the work has been to focus on the evaluation of the EMEP/MSC-W CTM with measurements from different platforms (satellite, ground-based, in situ) and to identify the biases or the errors in the simulation. This evaluation is important in order to establish the capabilities of the model to identify air pollution sources. Regional distributions and temporal variation of main pollutants are thus discussed. For example, the daily variation in Ox is well captured while the NOx is under-predicted and the O3 is overestimated, especially in winter. The CTM performs also very well on day-to-day variation in PM25 or on the regional distribution in CO total column as over Beijing.",

CTMs are widely employed in atmospheric modeling to simulatethe transport and transformation of pollutants, but uncertainties in emission estimates cansignificantly impact the accuracy of air quality predictions. Our study systematically analyzesthe propagation of uncertainties arising from emissions. The emissions' uncertainties are consistentwith the CAMS regional emissions product and are calculated using detailed, countryspecificuncertainty estimates in activity data and generic emission factor uncertainties. Theuncertainties are calculated per source sector and country. The Local Fractions/Sensibilities [1]methodology available in the EMEP MSC-W model is a tool that allows computation of sourcereceptorrelationships more efficiently. In conjunction with analytical methods for uncertaintypropagation, we deliver air quality predictions with uncertainty estimates at a fraction of thecomputational cost and with increased traceability compared to modern surrogate modelingtechniques. In our study we focus on PM2.5 and PM10, and first results will be presented for theimpact of emission uncertainties on forecasted PM concentrations in European cities, as well asuncertainties in contributions from different source sectors and countries. By integrating emissionuncertainty propagation, our study aims to provide decision-makers with a more accurateassessment of the reliability of CAMS policy products under various atmospheric conditionsand in the future provide these estimates as part of their operational delivery.

Using the cutting-edge fabrication technology, we fabricated small-period triangular antidot lattice (as small as 70 nm), which has an effective honeycomb lattice constant of about 40nm, on GaAs quantum well. In the RILS measurement, the massless Dirac fermions are clearly revealed by the intersubband transition and low energy transitions, well described by modeling the AG band structure.

Despite the absence of liver toxicity in preclinical studies in rats and marmosets and in single dose clinical studies in humans, increased transaminase activities were observed in healthy subjects in multiple-dose clinical studies. We, therefore, initiated a comprehensive program to find out the mechanisms leading to hepatocellular injury using HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), HepaRG cells (inducible hepatocytes derived from a human hepatic progenitor cell line), and human liver microtissue preparations. Our investigations demonstrated a concentration- and time-dependent reduction of the ATP content of BAL30072-treated HepG2 cells and liver microtissues. BAL30072 impaired oxygen consumption by HepG2 cells at clinically relevant concentrations, inhibited complexes II and III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, BAL 30072 impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, inhibited glycolysis, and was associated with hepatocyte apoptosis. Co-administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine partially protected hepatocytes from BAL30072-mediated toxicity, underscoring the role of oxidative damage in the observed hepatocellular toxicity. In conclusion, BAL30072 is toxic for liver mitochondria and inhibits glycolysis at clinically relevant concentrations. Impaired hepatic mitochondrial function and inhibition of glycolysis can explain liver injury observed in human subjects receiving long-term treatment with this compound.",

Within the project we analysed existing regional climate models and developed an ensemble of bias corrected and localised climate change scenarios for the Western-Balkan Region. These scenarios are based on freely available regional climate change projections (EURO-CORDEX, MED-CORDEX) using the best freely available observational data for each sub-region. For further localisation of the scenarios, we developed a tool for \"Improving bias-corrected Climate Change scenarios with local OBServational data\" (ICC-OBS). By merging available gridded observational data for a selected area with station time series, the ICC-OBS tool first creates a dataset of gridded observations that is better tailored to the area of interest. In order to do so, gridded observations are interpolated to the location of the stations using nearest neighbour interpolation. Residuals are then calculated at the stations and interpolated to the grid. Depending on the number of stations either inverse distance weighting interpolation or ordinary kriging is used. The improved dataset is calculated by adding the interpolated residuals to the original gridded observations. Subsequently bias correction (scaled distribution mapping) is applied to climate model data using the modified gridded observations. To enhance the usability of the tool, an easy-to-use graphical user interface for the ICC-OBS tool was developed. It can be downloaded free of charge and used offline. Hence, the tool allows national experts to integrate their own observational data to further improve the climate model scenarios without having to share sensitive station data. The project is funded by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) and co-funded by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP).",

Lead isotope ratios of galena (PbS) and Sr isotope ratios of barite (BaSO4) of the polymetallic ore deposits, which are exposed on most of the islands, reveal two distinct sources of lead and strontium in the underlying basement of the core complexes.

Moreover, the pattern follows the surface trace of the proposed synorogenic Trans-Cycladic Thrust, a subduction-related structure that imbricated the high-pressure units. In addition, the isotopic composition of the hydrothermal minerals indicate that the structurally lower Cycladic Basement has a stronger influence on the metal sources of deposits occurring in the hanging wall of the Trans-Cycladic Thrust than in the footwall. Observations featuring the isotopic signature of hydrothermal minerals are complemented by a compilation of new and published isotopic and geochemical whole-rock data of the basement rock types. This allows us to further interpret the geodynamic significance of the apparent heterogeneities in the exposed rocks of the metamorphic core complexes and correlate the scattered exposures of the metamorphic basement. Furthermore, regional patterns in the isotopic and geochemical signature of the basement lithologies help to reconstruct the nature of the continental margin prior to Cretaceous-Eocene subduction.",

      "abstract": "An electronic analog model of the unsaturated zone has been developed, based on the similarity between the integrated flow equation (5) and Ohm's law. The main difference between the two equations is compensated for by amplifiers. The model simulates one day in 2 s. There are ten normal layers, each with adjustable magnitude. Moreover, there is a top layer in which infiltration, ponding and runoff are simulated, and a drain layer with adjustable drain intensity. The normal layers contain an adjustable resistor for the connection with another layer and a function generator for the k( θ) relation. There are two transition layers which have to be placed at the boundary between two layers of different soil properties. Under saturated conditions the model is acting incorrectly, so that a too small thickness of the saturated layers is calculated. This can be compensated for by using an equivalent drain intensity which is lower than the real one. The model can be used to simulate the effect of natural rainfall and evaporation on moisture content at every depth. Soil physical properties and drainage conditions can be adjusted. Homogeneous as well as layered soil can be represented by the model. In particular, it can be applied to investigate the drainage requirements of soils. Some examples of the applicability of the model and short technical description are presented.",

Possible relaxation mechanisms are considered, including proton-proton interactions, interactions between the protons and the unpaired electrons present in organic radicals, and interactions between the protons and the unpaired electrons present in paramagnetic oxygen. The effect of possible limitations in proton spin diffusion on relaxation behaviour has also been taken into account. For the two highest rank premium coals an unusually long relaxation time was observed. This was found to be due to the fact that these coals have never been exposed to air. The relaxation rates of the other coals were found to increase strongly with decreasing coal rank. It was concluded that this is due to an increasing amount of paramagnetic oxygen, trapped in the coals even after evacuation. It was also observed that for most coals the relaxation is non-exponential, with a non-exponentiality which increases for decreasing coal rank. This has been attributed to the presence of protons in both a molecular and a macromolecular phase in the coal, with an increasing amount of protons in the molecular phase for decreasing coal rank. The results were found to be consistent with those obtained in other coals of similar rank.",

Illustrative examples drawn from the administration of these simulation-based PA tasks to a sample of eighth-grade students (n = 74) highlight the potential of simulation-based tasks for revealing conceptual understanding of science concepts and for informing curriculum development within the context of design-based implementation research.

The pooled expert opinion was taken to be the outcome of averaging these opinions and shows that most emphasis should be given to the study of rain forest, coral reefs, and wetlands. Moreover, research is apparently needed on keystone species, protection of conservation areas, buffer zones, and management of protected areas. Genetic and biomedical studies or those focussing on genetic resources are considered relatively unimportant, as are studies on micro-organisms, but ecological studies of trees, large mammals, fish and coral are considered very important for nature conservation and management.",

It is shown that it is possible to determine a range of physically acceptable values for the refractive index of the passive film for thicknesses between 1.5 and 2.5 nm. The values found for the imaginary part - about 2-4 - indicate the semimetallic character of the film. The composition and the thickness of the film in the passive region from -600 to +450 mV (SSE) hardly change. In the transpassive region film growth and considerable change in composition were observed.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, decision-making by water authorities in the Netherlands is largely based on intuition. Their tasks were, after all, relatively few and straight-forward. The growing number of tasks, together with the new integrated approach on water management issues, however, induces water authorities to rationalise their decision process. In order to choose the most effective water management measures, the external effects of these measures need to be taken into account. Therefore, methods have been developed to incorporate these effects in the decision-making phase. Using analytical evaluation methods, the effects of various measures on the water system (physical and chemical quality, ecology and quantity) can be taken into consideration. In this manner a more cognitive way of choosing between alternative measures can be obtained. This paper describes an application of such a decision method on a river basin scale. Main topics, in this paper, are the extent to which uncertainties (in technical information and deficiencies in the techniques applied) limit the usefulness of these methods, and also the question whether these techniques can really be used to select measures that give maximum environmental benefit for minimum cost. It is shown that the influence of these restrictions on the validity of the outcome of the decision methods can be profound. Using these results, improvement of the methods can be realised.",

      "abstract": "Within this framework of extended geminal models, new and improved approximations are introduced for the calculation of electron triple pair correlation terms. There are three levels of increasing accuracy for these terms based on the coupled-cluster models: a model of single and double excitations, a model correct up to fourth order, and a model correct up to fifth order CCSD(TQ). A test calculation on the neon atom demonstrates that by adopting the CCSD(TQ) model for the triple pair correlation terms, the extended geminal model recovers 99.88% of the full CI valence shell correlation energy. To reduce the computational work involved in calculating double pair correlation terms and triple pair correlation terms, a modified set of natural orbital (NOs) is introduced. On the basis of these NOs a truncated virtual orbital space is defined. Test calculations on the neon atom, the helium dimer, and the helium trimer demonstrate that the dimension of this truncated space can be chosen to be considerably smaller than the dimension of the full virtual space at a small sacrifice in accuracy. The additive structure of the correlation terms implies that the models are appropriate for implementation on parallel processor computers. The extended geminal models have properties which make them ideally suited for describing intermolecular interactions: the models have a conceptual structure which facilitates interpretation, they can be applied for any intersystem distances, the models are size-extensive, they generate no basis set artifacts (basis set superposition errors), and the models are reliable and accurate.",

      "abstract": "Fabrication of structures for investigation of quantum effects frequently involves the use of MBE/CVD type growth processes to achieve control on an atomic scale in vertical direction and a wide range of combinations of lithography and pattern transfer techniques for control in lateral directions. The challenges ahead lie in the degree of lateral control with which the lithography can be performed, i.e. resolution and placement accuracy, but also in the throughput of the lithography equipment once technological applications are considered. Electron beam resolution can certainly extend to the 1 nm regime, in the case of the STM even to 0.1 nm, appropriate resist materials have to be found, however. Parallelism may be introduced into nanolithography through contact printing with X-rays, electron, ion, or X-ray projection, or arrays of miniaturized scanning electron or ion columns. Pattern transfer relies on a broad spectrum of subtractive and additive processes ranging from wet and dry etching to selective growth techniques. Pattern fidelity and damage to the material are the key issues.",

It is assumed that the shape of the crenulate shaped beach remains constant with time and expands with a rate according to a time function. Based upon a sediment balance, a simplified model of wave diffraction and refraction and a nearshore current model an expression for the shape function and the time function of crenulate shaped beaches is derived. It is shown that in the diffraction zone the time function should follow a t <SUP>1/3</SUP> law, while for the refraction zone the well known t <SUP>1/2</SUP> law is found. This implies that the evolution of a crenulate beach in the diffraction zone should initially be faster and on the long term slower than is found in refraction zones. The hypothesis is verified using available data. The resulting shape function of crenulate shaped beaches is expressed in terms of the diffracted wave field.",

      "abstract": "A new generation of geosynchronous multispectral imagers (ABI on the GOES-R series, AHI on Himawari-8/-9) dramatically improves upon the spatial, spectral and temporal resolution capabilities of heritage GEO imagers. This provides a unique opportunity to extend data records derived from low earth orbit polar orbiting imagers (MODIS on Terra and Aqua, VIIRS on Suomi NPP and the JPSS series) into the time domain. Previously, NASA developed a MODIS-VIIRS continuity algorithm for cloud optical property retrievals that leverages heritage algorithms-MODIS cloud mask (MOD35), MODIS optical and microphysical properties product (MOD06), and the NOAA AWG Cloud Height Algorithm. Because the ABI/AHI imagers mostly overlap with VIIRS with respect to the spectral channels used in the NASA VIIRS cloud product algorithm, porting the VIIRS algorithm to ABI/AHI is relatively straightforward. In addition, the GEO sensors have additional capabilities expected to be useful for cloud retrievals (e.g., atmospheric absorption channels, temporal information). <P />We will report on our continued efforts to port NASA VIIRS cloud and aerosol algorithms to the ABI/AHI GEO imagers. This includes running a beta version of both the NASA cloud and aerosol Dark Target (DB) products using AHI data in near-real time to support the NASA CAMP2Ex field campaign based in Manila during August - October of 2019. As part of these efforts we collaborated with the Worldview team to integrate the AHI imagery (true color, cloud, and aerosol products) into a custom version of Worldview designed to support the high temporal resolution of geo-stationary imagery. We de­­­ployed separate instances of Worldview at SSEC and on a local server located in the hanger in Manila allowing visualization of integrated GEO and LEO imagery. An overview of these new capabilities will be presented with a focus on our future efforts in both visualization and product development.",

The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond stands out because of its optically addressable electron spin, which shows long coherence time and viable initialization, manipulation and read-out at room temperature. In order to enable the use of this system for quantum information technology it's crucial to develop a procedure to deterministically engineer single artificial NV centers with nanometric positioning control and integrate them within an optoelectronic device. In this work, we demonstrate a method for chip-scale fabrication of arrays of single NV centers with record spatial localization of about 10 nm in all three dimensions and controllable inter-NV spacing as small as 40 nm, which approaches the length scale of strong dipolar coupling. Our approach uses masked implantation of nitrogen through nano-apertures in a thin gold film, patterned via electron-beam lithography and dry etching, which ensures excellent masking contrast for the implantation of 10 KeV nitrogen ions. We verified the position and spin properties of the resulting NVs through wide-field super-resolution optically detected magnetic resonance imaging.",

The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the literature on the reliability and validity of four FCEs: the Blankenship system (BS), the ERGOS work simulator (EWS), the Ergo-Kit (EK) and the Isernhagen work system (IWS). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in five databases (CINAHL, Medline, Embase, OSH-ROM and Picarta) using the following keywords and their synonyms: functional capacity evaluation, reliability and validity. The search strategy was performed for relevance in titles and abstracts, and the databases were limited to literature published between 1980 and April 2004. Two independent reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to select all relevant articles and evaluated the methodological quality of all included articles. Results: The search resulted in 77 potential relevant references but only 12 papers were identified for inclusion and assessed for their methodological quality. The interrater reliability and predictive validity of the IWS were evaluated as good while the procedure used in the intrarater reliability (test–retest) studies was not rigorous enough to allow any conclusion. The concurrent validity of the EWS and EK was not demonstrated while no study was found on their reliability. No study was found on the reliability and validity of the BS. Conclusions: More rigorous studies are needed to demonstrate the reliability and the validity of FCE methods, especially the BS, EWS and EK.",

We investigate the 4$f$ states in TmSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ throughout a semimetal-insulator phase transition, which drastically varies the interactions related to the 4$f$ states. Using synchrotron-based hard x-ray and extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve subtle peak splitting in the 4$f$ peaks near the Fermi level in the mixed-valent semimetal phase. The separation is enhanced by several tens of meV by increasing the lattice parameter by a few percent. Our results elucidate the evolving nature of the 4$f$ state across the phase transition, and provide direct experimental evidence for electronic interactions beyond the standard Anderson model in mixed-valence systems.",

      "abstract": "Polymetallic veins and breccias and carbonate-replacement ore deposits in the Cyclades continental back arc, Greece, formed from a range of fluid and metal sources strongly influenced by the dynamics of the late Mesozoic-Cenozoic Hellenic subduction system. These complexities are recorded in the isotopic signatures of hydrothermal barite. We investigated 17 mineral occurrences on four Cycladic islands and from Lavrion on the mainland. Here, barite occurs in almost all deposit types of Miocene to Quaternary age. We used a multiple isotope and geochemical approach to characterize the barite in each deposit, including mineral separate analysis of δ34S and δ18O and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry of 87Sr/86Sr and δ34S. Barite from carbonate-hosted vein and breccia Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization on Lavrion has a wide range of δ34S (2-20‰) and δ18O (10-15‰) values, reflecting a mix of magmatic and surface-derived fluids that have exchanged with isotopically heavy oxygen in the carbonate host rock. Sulfur (δ34S = 10-13‰) and oxygen (δ18O = 9-13‰) values of barite from the carbonate-hosted vein iron and barite mineralization on Serifos are permissive of a magmatic sulfate component. Barite from epithermal base and/or precious metal deposits on Milos has δ34S (17-28‰) and δ18O (9-11‰) values that are similar to modern seawater. In contrast, barite from vein-type deposits on Antiparos and Mykonos has a wide range of δ34S (16-37‰) and δ18O (4-12‰) values, indicating a seawater sulfate source modified by mixing or equilibration of the hydrothermal fluids with the host rocks. Strontium isotope ratios of barite vary regionally, with 87Sr/86Sr ≥ 0.711 in the central Cyclades and 87Sr/86Sr ≤ 0.711 in the west Cyclades, confirming the strong influence of upper crustal rocks on the sources of fluids, Sr, and Ba in the formation of ore.",

      "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have had an enormous impact on a multitude of sectors, from research to industry, generating an unprecedented demand for tailor-suited hardware platforms. Their training and execution is highly memory-intensive, clearly evidencing the limitations affecting the currently available hardware based on the von Neumann architecture, which requires frequent data shuttling due to the physical separation of logic and memory units. This does not only limit the achievable performances but also greatly increases the energy consumption, hindering the integration of ANNs into low-power platforms. New Logic in Memory (LiM) architectures, able to unify memory and logic functionalities into a single component, are highly promising for overcoming these limitations, by drastically reducing the need of data transfers. Recently, it has been shown that a very flexible platform for logic applications can be realized recurring to a multi-gated Schottky-Barrier Field Effect Transistor (SBFET). If equipped with memory capabilities, this architecture could represent an ideal building block for versatile LiM hardware. To reach this goal, here we investigate the integration of a ferroelectric Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) layer onto Dual Top Gated SBFETs. We demonstrate that HZO polarization charges can be successfully employed to tune the height of the two Schottky barriers, influencing the injection behavior, thus defining the transistor mode, switching it between n and p-type transport. The modulation strength is strongly dependent on the polarization pulse height, allowing for the selection of multiple current levels. All these achievable states can be well retained over time, thanks to the HZO stability. The presented result show how ferroelectric-enhanced SBFETs are promising for the realization of novel LiM hardware, enabling low-power circuits for ANNs execution.",

Systems comprising more than a thousand orbitals are investigated at the HF level of theory, with an emphasis on scaling properties. With our design, terms which formally scale quadratically with the system size, in effect have a better scaling because of the implicit screening introduced by the inherent adaptivity of the method: all operations are performed to the requested precision, which serves the dual purpose of minimizing the computational cost and controlling the final error precisely. Comparisons with traditional Gaussian-type orbitals based software, show that MRChem can be competitive with respect to performance.",

      "abstract": "Clouds are a critical component of the global radiation budget, and cloud radiative effects at the top-of atmosphere (TOA) and surface can significantly depend on the optical properties of the cloud. Passive spaceborne imagers, such as MODIS and VIIRS, can be used to retrieve cloud optical properties at spatial scales of 1-km or less. These imagers lack the broadband channels necessary to estimate broadband radiative fluxes, so retrieved cloud properties can be directly input into a radiative transfer model to obtain estimates of cloudy-sky radiative fluxes at the surface and TOA for the cloud imager spatial scales. Given the global and multi-decadal data record from MODIS, such pixel-level fluxes produced using MODIS cloud observations as inputs can provide a useful long-term and global cloudy-sky flux dataset. This dataset can also be extended to VIIRS when MODIS is no longer operational. <P />Newly developed pixel-level shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) surface and TOA radiative flux datasets calculated directly from two NASA MODIS/VIIRS Science Team cloud products, the MOD06 and MYD06 standard cloud products for Terra and Aqua, respectively (collectively referred to as MOD06) and the MODIS/VIIRS CLDPROP product for cloud climate data record continuity, are intercompared and evaluated globally against collocated ground- and satellite-based (i.e., NASA CERES) radiation measurements. Example pixel-level flux imagery is presented, as well as evaluations for different regions (e.g., polar vs. tropics) and cloud types (e.g., liquid vs. ice clouds). Level-3 globally gridded all-sky and cloudy-sky surface and TOA flux aggregations are also discussed, as well as ongoing efforts and updates on the development status of the MODIS/VIIRS flux datasets.",

MATSIM is carried out as co-investigation of the ESA ELIPS projects SORD and RADIS (commonly known as MATROSHKA), an international collaboration of more than 18 research institutes and space agencies from all over the world, under the science and project lead of the German Aerospace Center. During MATSIM a computer tomography scan of the MATROSHKA phantom has been converted into a high resolution 3-dimensional voxel model. The energy imparted and absorbed dose distribution inside the model is determined for various radiation fields. The major goal of the MATSIM project is the validation of the numerical model under reference radiation conditions and further investigations under the radiation environment at ISS. In this report we compare depth dose distributions inside the phantom measured with thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) and an ionization chamber with FLUKA Monte Carlo particle transport simulations due to <SUP>60</SUP>Co photon exposure. Further reference irradiations with neutrons, protons and heavy ions are planned. The fully validated numerical model MATSIM will provide a perfect tool to assess the radiation exposure to humans during current and future space missions to ISS, Moon, Mars and beyond.",

The results are compared with each other and with those of a liquid state NMR study reported earlier. It is found that in this way both the shapes and magnitudes of the various hindering potentials can be determined. <P />The result is that the methyl groups 1, 2 and 4 possess a threefold cosine-shaped potential with heights given by 7.7, 9.0 and 15.0 kJ/mol according to the solid state NMR measurements (from the INS study the values 7.5, 7.5 and 16.0 kJ/mol were obtained). For methyl group 6 a mixture of a three-and six-fold symmetry had to be taken into account in order to explain the experiments. Except for methyl group 4 the liquid state NMR results deviate from those obtained with the other two techniques. A possible cause for this discrepancy is discussed. <P />For the molecular structure it is concluded that the reorientations of the methyl groups 1 and 2 are influenced by mutual hindering and that the angle between the plane through the C<SUB>4</SUB>-O-C bond and the aromatic plane is small, whereas for the C<SUB>1</SUB>-O-C bond this angle is estimated to be about 70°.",

Characterization of the AG samples by photoluminescence at low temperature (about 4K) indicates modulation of 2D electron states. Low-lying electron excitations observed by resonant inelastic light scattering and interpreted with a calculated AG band structure confirm the formation of AG bands with a well-defined Dirac cone, evidence for the presence of massless Dirac fermions.

Understanding ecological effects of sea-ice is particularly important given current and future climate change, but a major obstacle is the impracticality of manipulating sea-ice at a relevant scale. However, large-scale anomalous events, such as those occurring in Commonwealth Bay, East Antarctica, provide opportunities for natural experiments. Historically, katabatic winds have kept Commonwealth Bay ice-free for most of each year, but since 2010, a massive grounded iceberg has resulted in year-round sea-ice cover. We surveyed benthic communities in Commonwealth Bay approximately 3 years after continuous sea-ice cover began and found algal bed communities in severe decline. The majority (~75 %) of large macroalgae were decomposing, and the remainder were discoloured or bleached, while approximately 40 % of encrusting coralline algae were bleached. Accompanying this, the presence of invertebrates such as ophiuroids and polychaetes suggests that communities are in the early stages of transitioning to an invertebrate-dominated state. With a known start date, monitoring benthic communities in Commonwealth Bay will allow quantification of rates of benthic regime shifts in response to sea-ice cover, and improve understanding of the vulnerability of polar ecosystems to climate change.",

      "abstract": "Simultaneous observations of the atmospheric electric potential gradient (PG) at Bharati and Maitri stations were studied from 2014 to 2016. A new regional diurnal pattern of fair-weather PG for the coastal Antarctic region, perhaps the ubiquitous characteristics of the PG for the coastal Antarctic region, has been identified. This pattern has a significant broad minimum around noon hours. It is around this time the wind speed is also maximum. The PG data of past years of Syowa, Vostok, and Carnegie Cruise were also used in this study. The surface wind distorts the fair-weather diurnal pattern of PG over Bharati more intensely than at Maitri. The katabatic wind effect on the PG at Bharati appears to be more intense than at Maitri. The topography and katabatic winds associated with the Lambert glacier could be the reason. The observation of Bipolar Air Ion Concentration (BAIC) suggests that the wind speed significantly affects the concentration by accumulation and dispersion. The concentration is maximum when the wind speed is minimum. As the air ion concentration controls the conductivity, the PG is expected to be minimum during these hours to produce an anomalous diurnal pattern in the PG at Bharati. Data quality is improved by measuring the PG with a field monitor at the surface level instead of at an elevated position. This study provides new hope in pursuing globally representative data of the PG for further investigations on the global thunderstorm activity and the solar-terrestrial weather relationship.",

      "abstract": "Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese civil C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) launched on 10 August 2016 by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), which operates in 12 imaging modes with a fine spatial resolution up to 1 m. As one of the primary users, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) operationally processes GF-3 SAR Level-1 products into ocean surface wind vector and plans to officially release the near real-time SAR wind products in the near future. In this paper, the methodology of wind retrieval at C-band SAR is introduced and the first results of GF-3 SAR-derived winds are presented. In particular, the case of the coastal katabatic wind off the west coast of the U.S. captured by GF-3 is discussed. The preliminary accuracy assessment of wind speed and direction retrievals from GF-3 SAR is carried out against in situ measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy measurements of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Only the buoys located inside the GF-3 SAR wind cell (1 km) were considered as co-located in space, while the time interval between observations of SAR and buoy was limited to less the 30 min. These criteria yielded 56 co-locations during the period from January to April 2017, showing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.46 m/s and 22.22° for wind speed and direction, respectively. Different performances due to geophysical model function (GMF) and Polarization Ratio (PR) are discussed. The preliminary results indicate that GF-3 wind retrievals are encouraging for operational implementation.",

Three simulations (L<SUB>s</SUB> = 120, L<SUB>s</SUB> = 135, and L<SUB>s</SUB> = 150) characterize the changing circulation. The atmosphere is dry, and model dynamics are hydrostatic. A modified TES thermal inertia map provides a realistic simulation of the polar thermal environment. The highest-resolution nest (18 km) resolves complex flows near the cap; zonal-mean easterlies (~10 m/s) and zonal-mean katabatic winds (~5 m/s) near the surface are relatively steady during this study. Katabatic flows are shallow (~300 m); the easterlies are deeper (~1.5 km). Transient eddies are very important within the first scale height; they are excited by mechanisms, and at locations, that change dramatically during this short study period. At L<SUB>s</SUB> = 120 they form along the residual cap edge with a zonal wave number one structure, producing strong excursion winds (10-15 m/s) that blow consistently across the cap. By L<SUB>s</SUB> = 135, strong eddies are seen to form on the northern slopes of Alba Patera and Tharsis. These eddies are quite suggestive of the large annular cloud structures seen in Hubble Space Telescope and Mars Orbital Camera imagery at this location and season and can traverse the high latitudes to reach the residual cap before dissipating. Eddies in the earlier two simulations appear to be primarily excited by energetic flows near the surface. By L<SUB>s</SUB> = 150 an early fall polar jet causes strong winter-like baroclinic eddies to develop. The transient eddies found in this study are probably important in the water cycle of the northern residual cap.",

Using radar reflectivity, nocturnal rainfall in the western Mediterranean area has been detected near the coast of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. More than 50 events have been recorded since 2009. MM5 mesoscale simulations of some of the recorded events allow us to establish that the most likely causes for these precipitation events are: (1) the interaction between cold air masses conducted by drainage and katabatic winds, and (2) a wetter and warmer synoptic wind. Two different episodes are presented: one in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, caused by stratiform clouds, which occurred at the mouths of three rivers; the other case, produced by convective clouds, occurred at the southern Iberian Peninsula and was caused by the drainage winds flowing down from some mountain ranges located close to the coast.",

To investigate the processes of formation, maintenance, and decay of these polynyas, a 13-year climatology of Antarctic atmospheric and surface conditions is assembled from numerical weather prediction model analyses and remotely sensed satellite observations. An analytical technique used previously to identify and track atmospheric low pressure systems is modified to identify polynyas from daily analyses of sea ice area. This information is used to prepare a set of monthly climatological conditions as well as their anomalies when a polynya is present. Previous studies have suggested a link between atmospheric forcing and polynya formation. Along with the drop in sea ice area, there is a drop in sea level pressure as well as an increase in atmospheric wind divergence when the Cosmonaut Sea polynya is present. In some months, the sea ice area decrease is preceded by the passage of an atmospheric low pressure system 1-2 days earlier, but due to the continuous presence of katabatic winds and the coarseness of the ECMWF data, there is not as definitive a relationship between wind divergence and sea level pressure or ice area. Errors associated with the processing of passive microwave remotely sensed data, as well as differences in spatial scale limit that can be determined about the ocean state from the data sets, suggest the need for improved surface classification techniques, as well as regional modeling studies.",

The genesis, dust provenance and transport mechanism for the Chengdu Clay, however, are still debated. In the present work, the Chengdu Clay and adjacent loess from the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the Chinese Loess Plateau and the Qinling Mountains were investigated. The content and grain size distribution of quartz, quartz δ<SUP>18</SUP>O, Sm-Nd isotopic system, rare earth elements and other trace element concentrations for the Chengdu Clay and its adjacent loess were analyzed. Based on comparison and spatial variation analysis, the results confirm that the Chengdu Clay is of aeolian origin. The dust provenance of the Chengdu Clay differs from those of the adjacent loess. The Chengdu Clay is possibly of local origin and is transported by an ancient katabatic wind over a short distance during glacial and stadial periods. The alluvial sediments in the northwestern Sichuan Basin are possibly the major sources of the Chengdu Clay. There is little possibility of an effective aeolian transport bringing dust from the Tibetan Plateau, the arid area in northwestern China or Inner Mongolia into the Sichuan Basin, where it may be deposited to form the Chengdu Clay. Thus, long-range dust transport by the East Asian winter monsoon, the westerly jet or the Tibetan Plateau winter monsoon possibly plays a minor role in controlling the magnitude of the dust flux of the Chengdu Clay in the Sichuan Basin.",

They may also be formed by wind, such as the megadunes on the Antarctic ice sheet. Spiral troughs on the polar ice caps of Mars have been interpreted to be cyclic steps formed by katabatic wind blowing over ice. Cyclic steps are relatives of upstream-migrating antidunes. Cyclic step formation on ice is not only a mechanical but also a thermodynamic process. There have been very few studies on the formation of either cyclic steps or upstream-migrating antidunes on ice. In this study, we performed flume experiments to reproduce cyclic steps on ice by flowing water, and found that trains of steps form when the Froude number is larger than unity. The features of those steps allow them to be identified as ice-bed analogs of cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers. We performed a linear stability analysis and obtained a physical explanation of the formation of upstream-migrating antidunes, i.e., precursors of cyclic steps. We compared the results of experiments with the predictions of the analysis and found the observed steps fall in the range where the analysis predicts interfacial instability. We also found that short antidune-like undulations formed as a precursor to the appearance of well-defined steps. This fact suggests that such antidune-like undulations correspond to the instability predicted by the analysis and are precursors of cyclic steps.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we analyse the morphometry of cirques in the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) to understand regional glacier formation and landscape evolution since the onset of Cenozoic glaciations. We find that, unlike most glacierised regions worldwide, aspect bias for cirques in the TAM is not particularly strong, indicating that glaciers were able to form and cirques develop on slopes with a variety of aspects. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that Antarctica's climate has been conducive to long-lived and extensive glaciation for many millions of years. Surprisingly, where cirques in the TAM show an aspect bias, this is typically towards the North, NW and/or NE, rather than favouring South-facing slopes where direct solar radiation is comparatively limited. This lack of a poleward aspect bias is unlike most cirque populations globally and indicates that total solar insolation was not a key control on where former glaciers in the TAM were able to initiate. Instead, we argue that prevailing wind directions played a dominant role in controlling the slopes on which past glacier development was favoured. Specifically, South-facing slopes in the TAM are directly exposed to katabatic winds which originate from the interior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). These slopes are therefore susceptible to wind deflation, with snow and ice being redistributed to lee-side slopes where it can accumulate due to protection from the wind. For this reason, North, NE and/or NW facing slopes may have favoured glacier development, and therefore resulted in a concentration of cirques with these aspects. This evidence suggests that most cirques in the TAM are no older 34 Ma, as outward radiating winds from the continent's interior could only have prevailed when the EAIS was present (in some form). By contrast, the very highest (and likely oldest) cirques in the TAM have more varied aspects, indicating that they may have formed before katabatic winds came to dominate, and by extension, before widespread growth of the EAIS at 34 Ma, and could perhaps have formed as far back as 60 Ma. In general, we find that cirques in the TAM have similar dimensions to those in other regions globally, despite having been occupied by glacial ice for far longer. Thus, our findings support a growing body of evidence which suggests that cirque size and glacier occupation times are not directly coupled, though there is some evidence of spatial variability in cirque size which might relate to the differences in the dynamics of former glaciers.",

      "abstract": "We have identified large spatiotemporal variability in the extent of supraglacial lakes on ice shelves in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. While large lakes were found over Nivlisen and Roi Baudouin ice shelf areas, only small lakes were mapped over Fimbulisen and Muninisen. Preliminary analyses reveal a positive correlation between supraglacial lake extents (over specific ice shelves) and mean summer (December, January, February) temperatures and Positive Degree Days from ERA5. However, these correlations do not explain the large variability in overall Dronning Maud Land assessments. For instance, Fimbulisen area has the warmest summer temperatures and highest sum Positive Degree Days with very low lake extents. In contrast, the adjacent Nivlisen area with similar summer statistics has large spread of supraglacial lakes over the ice shelf area. We also identified that over specific melt years (e.g., 2016-2017, high lake extents; 2020-2021, low lake extents), all ice shelf areas with supraglacial lakes in Dronning Maud Land had relatively similar local lake extents, indicating the role of both regional and local factors influencing the ponding of meltwater. In this work, we attempt to identify the factors influencing melting and ponding in Dronning Maud Land. For this purpose, we use outputs from ERA5-Land and Modèle Régional Atmosphèrique (MAR) which have a higher spatial resolution (~10 km) than ERA5 (~31 km). At coarser resolutions climate models are deficient to capture localized processes that may have a crucial role in influencing surface melting and ponding - e.g., the katabatic winds. Outputs at higher resolutions may better constrain such small-scale phenomena and by using these datasets we may resolve the knowledge gap surrounding the controlling factors. Atmospheric factors in consideration are katabatic winds, cloudiness, precipitation, and albedo. Environmental factors such as blue ice, firn air content and surface topography will also be assessed to ascertain their influencing role. The results of this analysis will help in understanding the near-future evolution of supraglacial lakes on Dronning Maud Land and provide important insight into the future ice shelf stability in the region and also for improving estimates of the Antarctic ice sheet mass budget.",

      "abstract": "GPR provides high resolution images of aeolian strata in frozen sand in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. The results have positive implications for potential GPR surveys of aeolian strata on Mars. Within the Lower Victoria Valley, seasonal changes in climate and a topographically-constrained wind regime result in significant wind reversals. As a consequence, dunes show reversing crest-lines and flattened dune crests. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys of the dunes reveal sets of cross-strata and low-angle bounding surfaces produced by reversing winds. Summer sand transport appears to be dominant and this is attributed to the seasonal increase in solar radiation. Solar radiation which heats the valley floor melts ice cements making sand available for transport. At the same time, solar heating of the valley floor generates easterly winds that transport the sand, contributing to the resultant westward dune migration. The location of the dune field along the northern edge of the Lower Victoria Valley provides some shelter from the powerful föehn and katabatic winds that sweep down the valley. Topographic steering of the winds along the valley and drag against the valley wall has probably aided the formation, migration and preservation of the dune field. Optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from dune deposits range from 0 to 1.3 kyr showing that the dune field has been present for at least 1000 yr. The OSL ages are used to calculate end-point migration rates of 0.05 to 1.3 m/yr, which are lower than migration rates reported from recent surveys of the Packard dunes and lower than similar-sized dunes in low-latitude deserts. The relatively low rates of migration are attributed to a combination of dune crest reversal under a bimodal wind regime and ice cement that reduces dune deflation and restricts sand entrainment.",

      "abstract": "Spectroscopic analysis of the Mars permanent North polar cap (NPC) by MEX/OMEGA and MRO/CRISM instruments reveal apparent seasonal changes in the ice morphology during the summer season, implying that ice surface becomes increasingly coarse during the progression of season. This general trend is non-uniform in space, being particularly strong near inner edges of the spiral terraces. The comparison of spectroscopic data with high-resolution images returned by MRO/HiRISE camera shows that the extent of NPC apparent seasonal change revealed by NIR spectroscopy correlates with the orientation of dunes on the ice surface. In the inner edges of the spiral terraces, dunes are aligned preferentially in zonal direction, implying their formation under control of the meridional winds. In turn at the outer edges, where seasonal changes are less evident, dunes are aligned mostly in the meridional direction, assuming impact of the zonal atmospheric flow. Indeed, zonally aligned dunes have better conditions in terms of sunlight exposure, and their surface is expected to reveal faster aging. However the question arises what processes are responsible for this alignment. We hypothesize that the dunes are formed under strong control of the local meteorology, dominated with competing mesoscale zonal circulation and local katabatic winds. In most cases the latter have meridional direction and maximize near the steepest relief, i.e. southward of the boundary between neighboring terraces. In some cases katabatic winds directions are in the strong interconnection with certain local and mesoscale topography features. Thus seasonal changes of the ice surface microstructure are connected with the relief on the scale of tens of meters, which in turn may be formed under influence of the local wind pattern controlled by large-scale relief of the North polar cap.",

They are typically joined in roughly linear strings or long depressions and these features are referred to here as \"lineations.\" The lineations tend to have one or occasionally two preferred directions. We have examined the MOC imagery for the North Cap and using high-resolution images that have good wide-angle context images were able to determine the lineation angles for 31 sites scattered over most of the ice cap. We propose a process that will produce linear features in the white areas, then relate the orientation of the lineations over much of the North Cap to these processes and the inferred ice flow direction. There is first-order agreement between the measured sign of the lineation angles and those predicted assuming ice flow. Higher accumulations and velocities are predicted in the catchment for ice that flows into Chasma Boreale. This comes from the indications that katabatic winds are concentrated in this catchment.",

      "abstract": "Air temperature is a key control in the exchange of energy fluxes at the glacier-atmosphere interface and also the main input variable in many of the melt models (both energy balance or temperature-index type of models) currently used to predict glacier melt across a variety of scales. The commonly used approach to derive distributed temperature inputs is extrapolation from point measurements, often located outside the glacier surface, with a lapse rate that is assumed to be constant in time and uniform in space. Previous work for debris free glaciers has shown that lapse rates depend on several factors such as katabatic wind, humidity and the presence of clouds and that they vary in space and time. A dominant control however seems to be the presence of katabatic wind. For debris covered glaciers, the driving forces of air temperature are likely to be different but little is known because of the scarcity of field observations. Few preliminary studies have suggested that there is a strong coupling between surface and 2 m air temperature, while strong katabatic wind does not develop on debris covered tongues. In this study, we examine the variability in air temperature and lapse rates, as well as its atmospheric controls under different meteorological settings for the debris covered Lirung Glacier in the Nepalese Himalayas. We use a recently collected data set of air and surface temperature at a network of locations on the glacier tongue during the pre-monsoon season and the entire monsoon season of 2012. Additionally an AWS was installed on the glacier allowing the collection of meteorological observations. We investigate differences in air temperature during different climatic conditions (monsoon vs. dry period, upvalley vs. downvalley wind, cloudy vs. clear-sky, etc.). We identify the main controls on temperature and discuss how appropriate the application of a temperature lapse rate is over a debris covered glacier by investigating the correlation between temperature and elevation for different conditions and temporal scales. There are clear differences between the monsoon and the dry period both in the magnitude of lapse rates and type of controls which should be taken into account for melt modelling under debris. We also assess the relationship of air and surface temperature. Lapse rates exist on the glacier during night time, but loose strength during day time, when the surface heats up and the coupling between air and surface temperature becomes strong. Spatial variations in surface temperature however cannot be explained by elevation, and we show that surface topography is important. We summarize possible applications of the new findings.",

Relationships between the synoptic meteorology and MABL thermodynamic structure are examined using a k-means cluster analysis, complemented by front and cyclone composite analyses. Seven distinct clusters are identified, five of which are consistent with an established climatology over the SO storm track. Two new clusters (C1 and C2) are introduced over the high-latitude SO. C1 is commonly located poleward of the ocean polar front near mesocyclones, while C2 is located along the Antarctic coastline. A multilayer cloud structure is frequently present in clusters in the vicinity of fronts and cyclones, while a single-layer coverage is more common in a suppressed environment, particularly at lower latitudes. A cloud-free, multilevel inversion is frequently observed in cluster C2, possibly linked to the descending, dry, katabatic winds off the Antarctic coast. A strong, primary inversion is typically present in clusters at lower latitudes with high mean sea level pressure. Across the SO storm track and higher latitudes (cluster C1), a multilevel inversion structure is also commonly observed. A preliminary analysis of two case studies suggests that upper level advection and detrainment of convection associated with mesocyclones are potential drivers of the multilayer cloud coverage over the high-latitude SO rather than the decoupling mechanisms common in the subtropics.",

      "abstract": "The PANSY radar is the first Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere/Incoherent Scatter (MST/IS) radar in the Antarctic region. It is a large VHF monostatic pulse Doppler radar operating at 47 MHz, consisting of an active phased array of 1045 Yagi antennas and an equivalent number of transmit-receive (TR) modules with a total peak output power of 500 kW. The first stage of the radar was installed at Syowa Station (69°00‧S, 39°35‧E) in early 2011, and is currently operating with 228 antennas and modules. This paper reports the project's scientific objectives, technical descriptions, and the preliminary results of observations made to date. The radar is designed to clarify the role of atmospheric gravity waves at high latitudes in the momentum budget of the global circulation in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, and to explore the dynamical aspects of unique polar phenomena such as polar mesospheric clouds (PMC) and polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). The katabatic winds as a branch of Antarctic tropospheric circulation and as an important source of gravity waves are also of special interest. Moreover, strong and sporadic energy inputs from the magnetosphere by energetic particles and field-aligned currents can be quantitatively assessed by the broad height coverage of the radar which extends from the lower troposphere to the upper ionosphere. From engineering points of view, the radar had to overcome restrictions related to the severe environments of Antarctic research, such as very strong winds, limited power availability, short construction periods, and limited manpower availability. We resolved these problems through the adoption of specially designed class-E amplifiers, light weight and tough antenna elements, and versatile antenna arrangements. Although the radar is currently operating with only about a quarter of its full designed system components, we have already obtained interesting results on the Antarctic troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, such as gravity waves, multiple tropopauses associated with a severe snow storm in the troposphere and stratosphere, and polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE).",

From image analyses, two locations of coastal polynyas in this region are identified; one in Breid Bay and the other along the shelf break. The areal coverage of the Breid Bay polynya is significantly related to the strength of katabatic winds, which maintain their strength over the coastal sea due to land topography favoring for their confluence, thereby being capable of removing newly formed ice. Land fast ice in the eastern part of the bay also plays an additional role in the formation mechanism. It is also found that the areal coverage of coastal polynyas in this region fluctuate coherently. Moreover, these fluctuations correspond to the synoptic index, which measures the strength of the offshore wind, with their peaks closely associated with the areal peaks. These facts strongly suggest the influence of synoptic scale weather on the formation and maintenance of polynyas in this region.",

Diurnal variations in the buoyancy difference between two main air masses coming from the Revees and Priestley glaciers are assumed to contribute to diurnal alteration of the wind direction at the Nansen ice sheet. The data recorded at three automatic weather stations (AWS) available that period are analysed. Using the wavelet analysis procedure, it is shown that the contribution of one-day variations of some basic meteorological parameters and their gradients (in particular of temperature and pressure) is important and comparable with synoptic ones. On the base of the diurnal variations some aspects of the local circulation have been explained.

All models simulate Antarctic climate well when compared with daily observed temperature and pressure, with nudged models matching daily observations slightly better than free-running models. The ensemble mean annual SMB over the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) including ice shelves is 2329±94 Gt yr<SUP>−1</SUP> over the common 1987-2015 period covered by all models. There is large interannual variability, consistent between models due to variability in the driving ERA-Interim reanalysis. Mean annual SMB is sensitive to the chosen period; over our 30-year climatological mean period (1980 to 2010), the ensemble mean is 2483 Gt yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. However, individual model estimates vary from 1961±70 to 2519±118 Gt yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. The largest spatial differences between model SMB estimates are in West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and around the Transantarctic Mountains. We find no significant trend in Antarctic SMB over either period. Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) mass loss is currently equivalent to around 0.5 mm yr<SUP>−1</SUP> of global mean sea level rise (Shepherd et al., 2020), but our results indicate some uncertainty in the SMB contribution based on RCMs. We compare modelled SMB with a large dataset of observations, which, though biased by undersampling, indicates that many of the biases in SMB are common between models. A drifting-snow scheme improves modelled SMB on ice sheet surface slopes with an elevation between 1000 and 2000 m, where strong katabatic winds form. Different ice masks have a substantial impact on the integrated total SMB and along with model resolution are factored into our analysis. Targeting undersampled regions with high precipitation for observational campaigns will be key to improving future estimates of SMB in Antarctica.",

      "abstract": "The atmospheric boundary layer dynamics near Ross Island and over West Antarctica has been investigated. The study consists of two parts. The first part involved the use of data from ground-based remote sensing equipment (sodar and RASS), radiosondes, pilot balloons, automatic weather stations, and NOAA AVHRR satellite imagery. The second part involved the use of a high resolution boundary layer model coupled with a three-dimensional primitive equation mesoscale model to simulate the observed atmospheric boundary layer winds and temperatures. Turbulence parameters were simulated with an E-epsilon turbulence model driven by observed winds and temperatures. The observational analysis, for the first time, revealed that the airflow passing through the Ross Island area is supplied mainly by enhanced katabatic drainage from Byrd Glacier and secondarily drainage from Mulock and Skelton glaciers. The observed diurnal variation of the blocking effect near Ross Island is dominated by the changes in the upstream katabatic airflow. The synthesized analysis over West Antarctica found that the Siple Coast katabatic wind confluence zone consists of two superimposed katabatic airflows: a relatively warm and more buoyant katabatic flow from West Antarctica overlies a colder and less buoyant katabatic airflow from East Antarctica. The force balance analysis revealed that, inside the West Antarctic katabatic wind zone, the pressure gradient force associated with the blocked airflow against the Transantarctic Mountains dominates; inside the East Antarctic katabatic wind zone, the downslope buoyancy force due to the cold air overlying the sloping terrain is dominant. The analysis also shows that these forces are in geostrophic balance with the Coriolis force. An E-epsilon turbulence closure model is used to simulate the diurnal variation of sodar backscatter. The results show that the model is capable of qualitatively capturing the main features of the observed sodar backscatter. To improve the representation of the atmospheric boundary layer, a second-order turbulence closure model coupled with the input from a mesoscale model was applied to the springtime Siple Coast katabatic wind confluence zone. The simulation was able to capture the main features of the confluence zone, which were not well resolved by the mesoscale model.",

This leads to spatial differences in physical properties of snow and surface roughness, as well as to the upwind migration of the megadunes. While previous studies agree that megadunes are a result of complex interactions between wind, topography, and snow, it is not clear how they form or why they accumulate on the windward side. Here we use ICESat observations, dimensional analysis, and atmospheric flow modeling to investigate what conditions are responsible for the accumulation patterns and upwind migration of the megadunes. First, we use ICESat data to quantify the pattern of differential surface elevation change across the megadunes. We then use dimensional analysis based on supercritical-flow theory and atmospheric flow modeling to show that the megadunes topography and a stable atmosphere will always lead to upwind dune migration. We show that a combination of persistent katabatic winds, strong stability, and spatial variability in surface roughness is responsible for the accumulation on the upwind slope and hence the upwind migration of the megadunes. We further show that spatial differences in surface roughness are the primary control on accumulation magnitudes and hence dune migration velocity. The dune migration velocity in turn influences the degree of snow-metamorphism and the physical properties of snow that are relevant for paleoclimate records. Our findings pertain to the ongoing evolution of the megadunes, but their genesis remains an open question.",

      "abstract": "This study analyzed daily patterns and dynamics of PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> concentrations in the Kathmandu Valley during three winters. The PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> data showed a daily repetitive cycle which represents influence of local air flow and dispersion and accumulation of air pollutants in the valley. Two concentration peaks were observed in the morning and in the evening periods, and they fell down during the daytime and the nighttime periods. This indicates local emission sources as major contributors in the valley. The more pronounced morning peak compared to the evening peak showed that the upslope wind in the morning helped to move the polluted inversion layer downward, subsequently adding to freshly emitted pollutants and causing a sharp pollutant concentration rise in the morning. Katabatic wind and rise of temperature in the basin during the day helped the pollutant upflow and dilution, resulting in a sharp PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> concentration decline. Through the afternoon, the decrease in air temperature followed by decrease in wind speed caused to lower PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> peaks in the evening. Also, higher morning peaks of PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> concentrations compared to the evening indicated pollution from the previous day is added to the fresh emission. The valley had increased PM <SUB loc=\"post\">2.5</SUB> from the beginning of October which continued till the first week of February.

The simulated results are compared with monthly mean surface observations from Iceland for 1991-2000 to demonstrate the high level of model performance; correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 for most variables considered.The simulation results are used to analyze the near-surface climate over Iceland. The simulated near-surface winds in winter are primarily katabatic. The land-sea-breeze circulation is clearly evident in summer. The land is colder than the ocean during winter, with a strong (weak) temperature gradient along the southern (northern) coast. This temperature pattern over the sloping terrain forces the katabatic wind. The diurnal cycle of near-surface air temperature is marked in summer over the land areas, which drives the land-sea breeze. The near-surface climate variations for extremes of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index during winter and summer result from the large-scale atmospheric advection conditions.The time-averaged mesoscale precipitation distribution over Iceland is reasonably well simulated by Polar MM5. Winter precipitation rates are double those during the summer, reflecting the much greater winter cyclonic activity. The simulated interannual precipitation variations during winter for 1991-2000 agree with those observed from snow accumulation measurements on the Vatnajökull ice cap. The winter precipitation decrease for 1991-2000 dominates the annual signal for all of Iceland except the northeastern and eastern parts where the precipitation increases. The large precipitation trends (decadal decrease of up to 50%) are caused by the eastward shift and weakening of the Icelandic low during the 1990s, as a result of changes in the NAO modulation of regional climate.",

The SBL is found to be continuously turbulent during katabatic flow situations with wind speeds exceeding 20 m/s in several cases. Aircraft data from six flights during different synoptic situations are summarized. For the first time, this allows the study of the turbulence structure in the katabatic wind system over the whole boundary layer and over a horizontal scale of 80 km. Almost all data were collected above the surface layer and can be attributed to the regions of local scaling or z-less scaling. The local scaling concept was found to be valid also for these strong katabatic wind conditions, but the present data represent an extension to strong stabilities that are missed by previous studies.",

Understanding the convective zone and its possible relationship to surface conditions is important for constructing accurate ice-core greenhouse gas chronologies and their phasing with respect to climate change. The thickness of the convective zone was inferred from a regression line with barometric slope of the data in the deep firn. It is less than a few meters at H72 and NGRIP, whereas a substantial convective zone is found at Dome Fuji (8.6 ± 2.6 m) and YM85 (14.0 ± 1.8 m). By matching the outputs of a diffusion model to the data, effective eddy diffusivities required to mix the firn air are found. At the surface of Dome Fuji and YM85, these are found to be several times greater than the molecular diffusivity in free air. The crossover from dominance of convection to molecular diffusion takes place at 7 ± 2, 11 ± 2 and 0.5 ± 0.5 m at Dome Fuji, YM85 and NGRIP, respectively. These depths can be used as an alternative definition of the convective zone thickness. The firn permeability at Dome Fuji is expected to be high because of intense firn metamorphism due to the low accumulation rate and large seasonal air temperature variation at the site. The firn layers in the top several meters are exposed to strong temperature gradients for several decades, leading to large firn grains and depth hoar that enhance permeability. The thick convective zone at YM85 is unexpected because the temperature, accumulation rate and near-surface density are comparable to NGRIP. The strong katabatic wind at YM85 is probably responsible for creating the deep convection. The largest convective zone found in this study is still only half of the current inconsistency implied from the deep ice core gas isotopes and firn densification models.",

In polar regions, the roughness of the terrain, strong katabatic winds, unreliability of compass readings, and inaccessibility due to lack of infrastructure pose unique challenges for UAV surveying. To overcome these issues, we developed an open-source, low-cost, high-endurance, fixed-wing UAV equipped with GPS post-processed kinematic for the monitoring of ice dynamics and calving activity at several remote tidewater glaciers located in Greenland. Our custom-built UAV is capable of flying for up to 3 h or 180 km and is able to produce high spatial resolution (0.25–0.5 m per pixel), accurately geo-referenced (1–2 pixels) ortho-images and DEMs. We used our UAV to perform repeat surveys of six calving glacier termini in north-west in July 2017 and of Eqip Sermia glacier, west Greenland, in July 2018. The endurance of our UAV enabled us to map the termini of up to four tidewater glaciers in one flight and to infer the displacement and calving activity of Eqip Sermia at short (105 min) timescale. Our study sheds light on the potential of long-range UAVs for continuously monitoring marine-terminating glaciers, enabling short-term processes, such as the tidal effects on the ice dynamics, short-lived speed-up events, and the ice fracturing responsible for calving to be investigated at unprecedented resolution.",

      "abstract": "Martian polar regions host active regional wind circulations, such as the downslope katabatic winds which develop owing to near-surface radiative cooling and sloped topography. Many observations (stratigraphy from radar profiling, frost streaks, spectral analysis of ices) concur to show that aeolian processes play a key role in glacial processes in Martian polar regions. A spectacular manifestation of this resides in elongated clouds that forms within the polar spiral troughs, a series of geological depressions in Mars' polar caps. Here we report mesoscale atmospheric modeling in Martian polar regions making use of five nested domains operating a model downscaling from horizontal resolutions of twenty kilometers to 200 m in a typical polar trough. We show that strong katabatic jumps form at the bottom of polar troughs with an horizontal morphology and location similar to trough clouds, large vertical velocity (up to +3 m/s) and temperature perturbations (up to 20 K) propitious to cloud formation. This strongly suggests that trough clouds on Mars are caused by katabatic jumps forming within polar troughs. This phenomena is analogous to the terrestrial Loewe phenomena over Antarctica's slopes and coastlines, resulting in a distinctive \"wall of snow\" during katabatic events. Our mesoscale modeling results thereby suggest that trough clouds might be present manifestations of the ice migration processes that yielded the internal cap structure discovered by radar observations, as part of a \"cyclic step\" process. This has important implications for the stability and possible migration over geological timescales of water ice surface reservoirs-and, overall, for the evolution of Mars' polar caps over geological timescales.",

The origin of loess in SW Poland is attributed to the Great Odra Valley (GOV), following the general concept that large rivers play a major role in regional silt supply. Yet, the precise provenance (glacier sources and/or local rocks) of silts, possibly deflated from dry GOV braided riverbeds, is not clear. Our study of thin and thick loess mantles in SW Poland for the first time indicates the provenance of thin loess based on mineralogical (MLA-SEM) and isotopic analyses (<SUP>143</SUP>Nd/<SUP>144</SUP>Nd, <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr). Luminescence ages of five localities point to thin loess mantle formation during and shortly (23.0 to 17.7 ka yr) after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our isotopic data indicate that thin loess deposits in SW Poland are the mixtures of two main components - local Sudetic and Scandinavian, the latter delivered by the Fennoscandian ice sheet (FIS). Also, detailed analyses of heavy minerals show that a single mineral (e.g., hornblende) may come from both Sudetic and Scandinavian sources. This research highlights the role of the (Pleistocene) GOV in collecting and homogenizing materials, while supplying the region with fine particles to be deflated by paleowinds from open surfaces. Anomalies in mineralogy and isotopic composition are connected with influence of Sudetic mountain rivers and locally blowing silt material by katabatic winds. Regional grain size differentiation of thin loess mantles explains transport distance and altitude.",

We report here the first year-round measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) in the atmosphere and in snowpack interstitial air on the East Antarctic ice sheet. This unique data set shows evidence of an intense oxidation of atmospheric Hg(0) in summer (24-hour daylight) due to the high oxidative capacity of the Antarctic plateau atmosphere in this period of the year. Summertime Hg(0) concentrations exhibited a pronounced daily cycle in ambient air with maximal concentrations around midday. Photochemical reactions and chemical exchange at the air-snow interface were prominent, highlighting the role of the snowpack on the atmospheric mercury cycle. Our observations reveal a 20 to 30 % decrease of atmospheric Hg(0) concentrations from May to mid-August (winter, 24 h darkness). This phenomenon has not been reported elsewhere and possibly results from the dry deposition of Hg(0) onto the snowpack. We also reveal the occurrence of multi-day to weeklong atmospheric Hg(0) depletion events in summer, not associated with depletions of ozone, and likely due to a stagnation of air masses above the plateau triggering an accumulation of oxidants within the shallow boundary layer. Our observations suggest that the inland atmospheric reservoir is depleted in Hg(0) in summer. Due to katabatic winds flowing out from the Antarctic plateau down the steep vertical drops along the coast and according to observations at coastal Antarctic stations, the striking reactivity observed on the plateau most likely influences the cycle of atmospheric mercury on a continental scale.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics over glaciers are of great interest as they can modify the response of glacier mass balance to large scale climate forcing. A key feature of the glacier ABL is formation of katabatic winds driven by turbulent sensible heat exchange with a cooler underlying ice surface. These winds can markedly alter the spatio-temporal distribution of air temperature over glacier surfaces from the environmental lapse rate, which in turn affects the distribution of melt. An intensive field campaign was conducted over 13 days in June 2015 at Athabasca Glacier, an outlet of Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Multiple automatic weather stations, eddy covariance systems, distributed temperature sensors, SODAR and kite profiling systems were used to characterise how the glacier ABL evolved spatially and temporally, how the differences in glacier ABL properties were related to valley and regional circulation and what effect these differences had on surface lapse rates. In general strong daytime down-glacier winds were observed over the glacier. These winds extended well beyond the glacier into the proglacial area and through the depth of lower ice-free valley. On most days wind speed was consistent or increasing through to the top of the above-glacier profiles (100 to 200 m), indicating a quite well mixed surface boundary layer. A wind speed maximum in the lowest few metres above the glacier surface, characteristic of a katabatic wind, was only observed on one day. The dominant circulation within the valley appears to be what could be termed an 'icefield breeze'; strong down-glacier winds driven by mesoscale pressure gradients that are set up by differential suface heating over the non-glaciated valleys and much the larger Columbia Icefield upstream of the glacier. The effect of the different circulations on lapse rates will be explored with a view to developing variable lapse rates for modelling glacier mass balance.",

One popular hypothesis posits that the spiral pattern resulted as troughs underwent poleward migration. Here, we show that the troughs are extensively segmented into enclosed depressions (or cells). Many cell interiors display concentric layers that connect pole- and equator-facing slopes, demonstrating in-situ trough erosion. The segmentation patterns indicate a history of gradual trough growth transversely to katabatic wind directions, whereby increases in trough intersections generated their spiral arrangement. The erosional event recorded in the truncated strata and trough segmentation may have supplied up to ~25% of the volume of the mid-latitude icy mantles. Topographically subtle undulations transition into troughs and have distributions that mimic and extend the troughs' spiraling pattern, indicating that they probably represent buried trough sections. The retention of the spiral pattern in surface and subsurface troughs is consistent with the megastructure's stabilization before its partial burial. A previously suggested warm paleoclimatic spike indicates that the erosion could have occurred as recently as ~50 Ka. Hence, if the removed ice was redeposited to form the mid-latitude mantles, they could provide a valuable source of near-surface, clean ice for future human exploration.",

      "abstract": "We have developed a 5.5 year climatology of atmospheric transport into the Antarctic troposphere, which uses the same data set and methods as described in a recent study for the Arctic. This allows direct comparisons of transport properties for the two polar regions. The climatology is based on a simulation with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, where the model atmosphere was globally filled with particles. Transport characteristics as well as emission sensitivities were derived from 6 hourly particle positions. We found that the probability for near-surface air to originate from the stratosphere on a time scale of 10 days is an order of magnitude higher near the South Pole than near the North Pole, a result of higher topography and descent that partly compensates for the flow of air down the Antarctic Plateau with the katabatic winds. The stratospheric influence is largest in fall, which is opposite to the seasonality in the Arctic. Stratospheric influence is much smaller over the shelf ice regions and in a band around Antarctica. The average time for which air near the surface has been exposed to continuous darkness in July (continuous light in January) is longest over the Ronne Ice Shelf and Ross Ice Shelf at ∼11 days (20 days). We calculated how sensitive Antarctic air masses are to emission input up to 30 days before arriving in Antarctica if removal processes are ignored. The emission sensitivity shows strong meridional gradients and, as a result, is generally low over South America, Africa, and Australia. For a 10 day time scale, the largest emission sensitivities over these continents are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than over Eurasia for transport to the Arctic, showing that foreign continents have a much smaller potential to pollute the Antarctic than the Arctic troposphere. Emission sensitivities and derived black carbon (BC) source contributions over South America, Africa, and Australia are substantially (a factor 10 for Africa) larger in winter than in summer. In winter, biomass burning contributes more BC than anthropogenic sources. For typical aerosol lifetimes of 5-10 days, ship emissions south of 60°S account for half of the total BC concentrations in the lowest 1000 m of the atmosphere south of 70°S in December. The increasing number of tourists visiting Antarctica and fishing vessels operating close to Antarctica are, therefore, a matter of concern.",

      "abstract": "We compare 5 years of meteorological records from automatic weather stations (AWSs) on Storbreen and Midtdalsbreen, two glaciers in southern Norway, located approximately 120 km apart. The records are obtained from identical AWSs with an altitude difference of 120 m and cover the period September 2001 to September 2006. Air temperature at the AWS locations is found to be highly correlated, even with the seasonal cycle removed. The most striking difference between the two sites is the difference in wind climate. Midtdalsbreen is much more under influence of the large-scale circulation with wind speeds on average a factor 1.75 higher. On Storbreen, weaker katabatic winds are dominant. The main melt season is from May to September at both locations. During the melt season, incoming and net solar radiation are larger on Midtdalsbreen, whereas incoming and net longwave radiation are larger on Storbreen, primarily caused by thicker clouds on the latter. The turbulent fluxes are a factor 1.7 larger on Midtdalsbreen, mainly due to the higher wind speeds. Inter-daily fluctuations in the surface energy fluxes are very similar at the AWS sites. On average, melt energy is a factor 1.3 larger on Midtdalsbreen, a result of both larger net radiation and larger turbulent fluxes. The relative contribution of net radiation to surface melt is larger on Storbreen (76%) than on Midtdalsbreen (66%). As winter snow depth at the two locations is comparable in most years, the larger amount of melt energy results in an earlier disappearance of the snowpack on Midtdalsbreen and 70% more ice melt than on Storbreen. We compare the relative and absolute values of the energy fluxes on Storbreen and Midtdalsbreen with reported values for glaciers at similar latitudes. Furthermore, a comparison is made with meteorological variables measured at two nearby weather stations, showing that on-site measurements are essential for an accurate calculation of the surface energy balance and melt rate.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric circulation over complex terrain is governed by both synoptic forcing and thermal circulation induced by radiative heating or cooling of the ground surface. At night or in winter, when the synoptic forcing is weak enough, the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer in a deep valley is dominated by katabatic (downslope) winds. As predicted theoretically and shown by in situ measurements, temporal oscillations in katabatic winds occur along the slope. When the atmosphere is stably-stratified, the frequency of these oscillations is proportional to the local Brunt-Väisälä frequency N and to the sine of the slope angle, as is well-known. Such an unsteady katabatic wind in a stably-stratified atmosphere must generate internal gravity waves. Numerical investigation of the dynamics of the stably-stratified atmosphere in an idealized valley using the ARPS code has shown that large scale waves are emitted, with frequency equal to about 0.8N whatever the value of N and the angle of the slope. Physical arguments have been provided to account for this behavior (Chemel et al., Meteo. Atm. Physics, 2008; Largeron et al., in preparation). The aim of the present paper is to analyze the turbulent properties of this flow, in terms of induced fluid mixing. Two sources of turbulence are expected, which are associated with the katabatic wind and with the internal gravity waves, when breaking. To quantify mixing, we have implemented an analysis of mixing based upon the work of Winters &amp; D'Asaro (J. Fluid Mechanics, 1996), which enables one to compute exactly the turbulent heat flux associated with mixing. Results will be presented in terms of a local turbulent diffusivity, whereof spatial and temporal variability will be discussed.",

The detailed features are identified using the concepts and scaling of stably stratified flow over large mountains with variations in surface roughness, elevation, and heating. For westerly and easterly winds detached jets form at the southern tip, where coastal jets converge, which propagate large distances across the ocean. Near coasts katabatic winds can combine with barrier jets and wake flows generated by synoptic winds. Note how the approach flow rises/falls over southern Greenland for easterly/westerly winds, leading in both cases to more cloud on the western side. Some conclusions are drawn about the large-scale influences of these flows; detached jets in the atmosphere; air-sea interaction; formation of low pressure systems. For accurate simulations of these flows, mesoscale models are necessary with resolutions of order of 20 km or less.",

      "abstract": "The North Polar Cap of Mars is associated with different kinds of superficial sediments, including the Circumpolar Dune Field and sedimentary veneers scattered over the ice cap. In order to resolve the mineralogical composition of these sediments, we processed OMEGA and CRISM hyperspectral data with an original method based on spectral derivation (Huguenin and Jones, 1986). We find that gypsum is present in all areas where undefined hydrated minerals had been previously detected (Poulet et al., 2008; Horgan et al., 2009; Calvin et al., 2010), including the superficial sedimentary veneers found on the North Polar Cap and the whole Circumpolar Dune Field. Integrated morphological and structural analyses reveal that these gypsum crystals derive directly from the interior of the ice cap (Massé et al., 2010). The source of sedimentary veneers is the dust that was previously contained in the upper part of the ice cap, the ice-rich North Polar Layered Deposits (NPLD). This gypsum-bearing dust was exhumed, on south-facing slopes of spiral troughs and arcuate scarps, by ice ablation induced by katabatic winds. By the analysis of all associations of erosional scarps and dune fields over the North Polar Cap, we also demonstrate that the source of the polar dunes are sand-sized particles that were previously contained in the sediment-rich BU (Basal Unit), corresponding to the lower part of the ice cap. These particles were exhumed from the BU, by regressive ablation of the ice at marginal scarps that border the North Polar Cap, or by vertical ablation of the ice on Olympia Planum. From a reconstruction of wind flow lines over and around the ice cap, we infer that katabatic winds descending from the polar high and rotating around the North Polar Cap are responsible for the exhumation of this gypsum-bearing sand and for its redistribution in the Circumpolar Dune Field. The intensity of gypsum diagnostic spectral absorption bands decreases along wind flow lines in the Circumpolar Dune Field, which we interpret as indicating that the size of the gypsum particles decreases as the distance from their source increases (Langford, 2003; Grhefat et al., 2007). Comparisons with sulfates found in terrestrial glaciers (Ohno et al., 2006; Iizuka et al., 2006 and 2008) suggest that gypsum crystals that were trapped in the North Polar Cap before their exhumation had formed initially by weathering of dust particles either in the atmosphere and/or in the ice cap.",

      "abstract": "A general circulation model with geography constrained by Cassini is used to predict how ethane precipitation in Titan's lower stratosphere varies with latitude, season, and orbital forcing over the past 100 kyr. Ethane precipitation is generally more prevalent near the winter pole, where stratospheric ethane is transported downward toward the cold trap, and this general pattern is relatively insensitive to orbital parameter variations and geography. However, eccentricity-driven seasonal temperature variations modulate the seasonal asymmetry of ethane precipitation to some extent. The annual ethane precipitation does not monotonically increase from equator to pole but maximizes at selected sites, preferentially over empty deep basins such as Hagal Planitia. Local enhancement of ethane precipitation is caused by katabatic winds from plateau to basin and an associated regional-scale thermally direct circulation over the slope, which induces strong adiabatic cooling near the tropopause. The observed putative ethane clouds off the poles are evidence that ethane condensation is affected by topography. Preferential ethane precipitation over basins may increase the irregularity of Titan's shape by isostatic crustal subsidence after substitution of enclathrated methane by percolated ethane.",

      "abstract": "As a special underlying surface, air temperature near glacier surface is significantly lower than the temperature of free atmosphere at the same altitude because of the influence of katabatic wind. How to accurately estimate the air temperature of glaciered regions by using the data of non-glaciered area is important for the accurate assessment of glacier melting and their hydrological response to future climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. Based on four automatic weather stations（AWSs） at different elevations on Parlung No.4 Glacier in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, we analyzed the characteristics of temperature fluctuation between the glaciered and the non-glaciered area. Meanwhile we evaluated the performance of three popular methods for air temperature estimation: the traditional linear model (DT model), piecewise linear model (SM model) and simplified thermodynamic model (GB model). Our results evidenced that the SM model has the ability to estimate the air temperature at three AWSs on the glacier surface; the application of the traditional DT model has good performance in the non-glaciered region but will lead to significant overestimation in ablation region on the glaciered region, with about 40% overestimation of the positive accumulated temperature in summer (June to August) for the Parlung No.4 Glacier. The performance of the GB model is slightly better than the DT model, with large uncertainties introduced by many parameters including the thickness of katabatic boundary layer and the location of katabatic wind development, which reduces its operability on the large-scale temperature estimation. Future studies should be focused on the parameterized the SM model on the different-scale glaciers in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau.",

The Eta model simulates a katabatic wind system which develops qualitatively in agreement with the polynya extent, as shown in the satellite images during the same period. The results demonstrate the strong effect of the polynya when included in the initialization of model integrations: the low-level wind is intensified by the presence of the warm area corresponding to the polynya, it is spatially variable and significantly different from one simulated along the coast of the Nansen Ice Sheet. The results of numerical simulations with different surface temperatures in the polynya area are shown as well, thus an assessment of the range of variability of the wind intensity in relation to the polynya surface temperature is provided.",

These clouds are believed to be a product of either an atmospheric bore wave or a hydraulic jump generated by nightly katabatic winds. The Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System was used to study the interaction of the katabatic flows with the surrounding atmosphere to determine what mechanism is responsible for the clouds. Simulations at L=90°, 100°, 142°, 180°, 270°, and 358° were conducted focusing on the eastern flank of Olympus Mons. Model results compare well with Viking observations and closely approximate theoretical treatments of atmospheric bores. Strong downslope flows are simulated during the night, with a bore wave forming on and behind a well-defined katabatic front. The observed seasonality of the clouds was reproduced in the simulations; the bore was deeper and faster during northern summer and weakest during the winter. When the bore was strong, it was undular in form, and generated vertically propagating gravity waves in the atmosphere above. During the winter, the atmospheric structure was such that any gravity waves generated damped with height. Less atmospheric water vapor abundance during northern winter, as compared to the summer, is also a factor in the seasonality of the wave clouds. This study concludes that bore waves are the most likely mechanism for the generation of the observed linear wave clouds.",

Despite continuous attempts to decipher mechanisms controlling the local and regional SMB, a clear understanding of the separate components is still lacking, while snowfall measurements are almost absent. In this study, the different terms of the SMB are quantified at the Princess Elisabeth (PE) station in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Furthermore, the relationship between snowfall and accumulation at the surface is investigated. To achieve this, a unique collocated set of ground-based and in situ remote sensing instrumentation (Micro Rain Radar, ceilometer, automatic weather station, among others) was set up and operated for a time period of 37 months. Snowfall originates mainly from moist and warm air advected from lower latitudes associated with cyclone activity. However, snowfall events are not always associated with accumulation. During 38 % of the observed snowfall cases, the freshly fallen snow is ablated by the wind during the course of the event. Generally, snow storms of longer duration and larger spatial extent have a higher chance of resulting in accumulation on a local scale, while shorter events usually result in ablation (on average 17 and 12 h respectively). A large part of the accumulation at the station takes place when preceding snowfall events were occurring in synoptic upstream areas. This fresh snow is easily picked up and transported in shallow drifting snow layers over tens of kilometres, even when wind speeds are relatively low (&lt; 7 ms<SUP>-1</SUP>). Ablation events are mainly related to katabatic winds originating from the Antarctic plateau and the mountain ranges in the south. These dry winds are able to remove snow and lead to a decrease in the local SMB. This work highlights that the local SMB is strongly influenced by synoptic upstream conditions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the development of katabatic wind systems above mountain glaciers is essential to better constrain the response of the local glacier microclimate and surface melting to large-scale climate forcing. The vertical turbulent flux profiles, and consequently turbulent fluxes at the glacier surface during katabatic flow, depend strongly on the height of the near-surface katabatic jet. However, direct measurements of jet heights are rare as they require balloon soundings or meteorological towers; neither of which are appropriate for long-term installation on glaciers. In this study, we conduct a multi-month field campaign in the summer of 2023 on the Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Yukon, Canada, measuring mean meteorological variables (up to 5m above the glacier surface), and turbulent fluxes at three heights (1m, 2m, and 3m above the surface) derived from eddy-covariance measurements. Over 30 hours of atmospheric profiling with wind and temperature sensors tethered to a kite provides temporally and spatially high-resolution vertical profiles of katabatic flow. Using Multi-Resolution Flux Decomposition (MRD) applied to the eddy-covariance data from only one near-surface sonic anemometer, we introduce a method to infer the height of the katabatic wind speed maximum using the length scales of the most energetic eddies contributing to the heat flux. The inferred katabatic height for each 30-min interval of observations agrees with the corresponding measured 30-min average height from the atmospheric profiling, with a correlation of 0.73 and a mean bias error of 0.3m between the two datasets. We demonstrate that turbulent mixing lengths of momentum and heat fluxes can also be quantified with the use of MRD on the eddy-covariance data, and we propose a simple modification in the parametrizations of mixing-length models accounting for the near-surface katabatic jet. We corroborate these findings with data collected as part of the Second Meteor Crater Experiment (METCRAX II), providing tower-based measurements of deep katabatic flow at non-glacier terrain in the Arizona Meteor Crater.",

      "abstract": "High altitude meteorology plays a crucial role in determining glacier viability, yet in situ observations are lacking, particularly for the Himalaya. This research presents meteorological data from five weather stations, with elevations ranging from 2,680 to 5,600 metres, in the glaciated Khumbu catchment of the Nepal Himalayas, for the period 2009-2012. There is high spatial variability in temperature, largely associated with elevation. The onset and decay of the monsoon is evident at all stations. It is characterised by increased and less variable temperatures, humidity levels (≥90%) and precipitation, with drizzle being the most common precipitation type. The study of monsoon activity is essential as glaciers are reliant on monsoonal precipitation for accumulation in this region. There is decreased diurnal variability in wind speeds, and wind directions are consistently southerly relative to the pre and post monsoon periods. Valley orientation largely dictates the dominant wind direction, and south/north orientation of the Khumbu valley aids the signal of the southerly monsoon wind for most stations. There was evidence of a persistent katabatic wind from the debris-covered Changri Nup glacier, and the associated clean ice fall at the Kala Patthar station at 5,600 metres elevation. Such specific small-scale processes, such as katabatic winds or drainage flows in valleys, significantly influence local temperatures and winds. This emphasises the need for inclusion of small-scale processes in climate downscaling and glacier modelling. Temperature showed a changing sub-diurnal cycle with season, with a dampened cycle during the monsoon. This raises the question as to whether climate downscaling needs to include a specific process to account for seasonal and diurnal patterns in meteorological variables such as temperature. This study provides an insight into the meteorology of a high elevation, glaciated catchment and revealed how catchment-scale topography and atmospheric circulations strongly influence temperature, precipitation and winds. It also emphasises the importance of using local meteorological data for glacier modelling, both for validation and downscaling of climate models, and for use in glacier mass balance studies.",

      "abstract": "Low-level mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) are common in the Arctic. Both local and large-scale phenomena influence the properties and lifetime of MPCs. Arctic fjords are characterized by complex terrain and large variations in surface properties. Yet, not many studies have investigated the impact of local boundary layer dynamics and their relative importance on MPCs in the fjord environment. In this work, we used a combination of ground-based remote sensing instruments, surface meteorological observations, radiosoundings, and reanalysis data to study persistent low-level MPCs at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, for a 2.5-year period. Methods to identify the cloud regime, surface coupling, and regional and local wind patterns were developed. We found that persistent low-level MPCs were most common with westerly winds, and the westerly clouds had a higher mean liquid (42 g m<SUP>-2</SUP>) and ice water path (16 g m<SUP>-2</SUP>) compared to those with easterly winds. The increased height and rarity of persistent MPCs with easterly free-tropospheric winds suggest the island and its orography have an influence on the studied clouds. Seasonal variation in the liquid water path was found to be minimal, although the occurrence of persistent MPCs, their height, and their ice water path all showed notable seasonal dependency. Most of the studied MPCs were decoupled from the surface (63 %-82 % of the time). The coupled clouds had 41 % higher liquid water path than the fully decoupled ones. Local winds in the fjord were related to the frequency of surface coupling, and we propose that katabatic winds from the glaciers in the vicinity of the station may cause clouds to decouple. We concluded that while the regional to large-scale wind direction was important for the persistent MPC occurrence and properties, the local-scale phenomena (local wind patterns in the fjord and surface coupling) also had an influence. Moreover, this suggests that local boundary layer processes should be described in models in order to present low-level MPC properties accurately.",

Its optical and dynamic features suggest a delicate balance of the atmospheric agents involved. This has been confirmed by a thorough analysis of a well documented event and by statistics covering a whole summer season. As an exemplary event, the regional development of the associated cloud has basically been documented with synchronous surface data along a suitable transect of the glacier. Data from tethered balloons, radiosoundings and routine synoptic data have also been exploited extensively. Cloud development was generally aided by a high moisture potential because of proximity to the open seas and the remnants of a frontal system. Furthermore the occurrence of the cloud phenomenon was associated with onshore (southerly) surface winds, assisting advection and lifting of the associated air masses above the slopes of the ice sheet. Northward protrusion of the associated cloud was apparently opposed by continuous katabatic winds and topographically induced lee effects.",

Particular emphasis is placed on nocturnal katabatic winds (slope flows) and on upstream blocking of stratified flow. These phenomena are first examined independently, and then are combined so that their interactions can be evaluated. Upstream blocking in the absence of thermal forcing is found to be reasonably well described for air quality assessment purposes by the critical dividing streamline hypothesis. It is found that the highest pollutant concentrations are obtained on the windward side of the topography for contaminant sources within the blocked region and on the lee side for sources above the blocked region. Sensitivity experiments indicate that nocturnal slope flows decrease in intensity as the ambient thermal stratification increases. It is also found that slope winds can lead to high pollutant concentrations on windward slopes even when the Froude number is well above the range where upstream blocking is expected. Reasons why this behavior was not observed in previous studies of tracer flow around small hills are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Permafrost thaw has been observed at several locations across the pan-Arctic in recent decades, yet the pan-Arctic extent and potential spatial-temporal variations in thaw are poorly constrained. Thawing of ice-rich permafrost can be inferred and quantified with satellite imagery due to the subsequent differential ground subsidence and erosion that in turn affects land surface cover. Information contained within existing and rapidly growing collections of high-resolution satellite imagery (Big Imagery) is here extracted across the Arctic region through a collaboration between software engineers, computer- and earth scientists. More specifically, we are a) developing geospatial data down to sub-meter resolution, and also b) enabling discovery and knowledge-generation through visualization tools. This cyberinfrastructure platform, the Permafrost Discovery Gateway (PDG), is being designed with input from users of the PDG, e.g. primarily the Arctic earth science community but also the general public. The PDG builds upon other NSF supported data management resources (Arctic Data Center and Clowder) and the Fluid Earth Viewer. The Fluid Earth Viewer, which is the first visualization tool implemented into the PDG, was initially created for the public to explore atmospheric and oceanographic visualizations and is here modified to support permafrost geospatial products, and a number of community built analytic tools to identify permafrost artifacts within satellite imagery. The effort also includes workflow optimization of remote sensing code for pan-Arctic sub-meter scale mapping of ice-wedge polygons from optical imagery. We are additionally actively engaging with the user-community to ensure that the PDG becomes useful, both in terms of the type of data contained within the PDG and the design of the visualization tools. The PDG has the potential to fill key Arctic science gaps, such as bridging plot to pan-Arctic scale findings, while also serving as a resource informing decisions regarding the economy, security, and resilience of the Arctic region.",

The research question was: what is the most effective way for OPs and IPs to obtain information concerning person-related factors, in the opinion of employees with chronic health problems? Three focus group discussions were conducted comprising of a total of 23 employees with work limitations due to chronic health problems. Employees discussed how physicians could best obtain information related to ten person-related cognitions and perceptions that are associated with work participation. The discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Employees indicated that information addressing person-related factors could best be obtained through discussing them directly during consultations, as opposed to the use of questionnaires or diaries. Important prerequisites to having fruitful conversations include a mutual trust between employee and physician, a sense of genuine physician interest, and the understanding of the physician of employees and their health concerns. Employees described various factors that influence these conversations, including the knowledge and communication skills of physicians, employee anxiety, and the atmosphere and time frame of the consultation. Information concerning the person-related factors of employees can best be obtained by discussing them during consultations. However, there has to be mutual trust, interest and understanding before employees feel comfortable to talk about these factors with a physician. OPs and IPs should consider these, and other identified factors, when asking about person-related factors during consultations.",

EPIC cloud products include cloud masking, cloud height, and cloud optical thickness. The EPIC cloud mask algorithm utilizes reflectance and channel ratio-based tests in the UV, VIS, and NIR, while cloud height is inferred from Oxygen A- and B-band observations and cloud optical thickness is retrieved using a single-channel technique (680 nm over land and 780nm over ocean). Over three years of data have been collected. One major strength of EPIC observations is the ability to observe one location multiple times during the sunlit hours, which has great potential for studying the daily cycle of the local climate systems.

      "abstract": "Advances in microfabrication technology have made possible the production of structures with ever decreasing dimensions. As the size of these structures approaches certain characteristic lengths, quantum mechanical effects become evident. Electron interference phenomena may be observed in systems whose size is on the order of the electron phase coherence length, l_{ phi}. l_{ phi} can be 1 μm or more at 1 K. For a wire of width less than l_{phi}, the constructive interference of electron partial waves which are elastically scattered by impurities leads to one-dimensional localization. This effect manifests itself in the form of a small correction to the low temperature residual resistance, as first predicted by D. J. Thouless in 1977. For a ring structure of diameter ~ l_{ phi}, electron quantum interference leads to oscillations in the magnetoresistance of the ring with periods h/e and h/2e. These oscillations are the solid state analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in vacuum. Narrow wires and rings of Al and Ag have been fabricated using x-ray and electron-beam lithography, with linewidths as narrow as 350 A. Magnetoresistance measurements on the rings reveal oscillations with fundamental periods h/e and h/2e. Measurements on the wires show one-dimensional localization effects with spin-orbit scattering and one -dimensional superconducting fluctuations. These effects are used to probe electron energy and phase relaxation mechanisms in narrow wires. It is found that at low temperatures, the primary mechanisms are electron-phonon scattering and electron-electron scattering. As the wire width becomes less than the electron thermal diffusion length, l_{rm T} ~ 1000 A, a new type of electron-electron scattering mechanism becomes evident: one-dimensional scattering with small energy transfers. For such narrow wires, this is the dominant mode of electron phase relaxation at low temperatures.",

It has been shown recently in research laboratory tests that polycrystalline thin-film cells of this general composition deposited onto inexpensive soda-lime glass substrates have solar-to-electric conversion efficiencies exceeding 17%. These small-area cells were deposited using vacuum technology which is difficult and expensive to scale up in area to square-meter flat-plate modules in a manufacturing arena. We discuss in this paper inexpensive, non-vacuum deposition technology which is inherently scalable to large-area deposition. We pay particular attention to electrodeposition of multilayer binary or ternary selenide precursors to be thermally annealed to form Cu(In,Ga)Se <SUB loc=\"post\">2</SUB> films of appropriate overall composition, elemental grading and smoothness.",

Similar to MODIS, the VIIRS imager provides visible through IR observations at moderate spatial resolution with a 1330 LT equatorial crossing consistent with MODIS on the Aqua platform. However, unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks key water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels used by the MODIS cloud algorithms for high cloud detection and cloud-top property retrievals (including emissivity), as well as multilayer cloud detection. In addition, there is a significant change in the spectral location of the 2.1 μm shortwave-infrared channel used by MODIS for cloud microphysical retrievals. The climate science community will face an interruption in the continuity of key global cloud data sets once the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua sensors cease operation. Given the instrument differences between MODIS EOS and VIIRS S-NPP/JPSS, we discuss methods for merging the 14+ year MODIS observational record with VIIRS/CrIS observations in order to generate cloud climate data record continuity across the observing systems. The main approach used by our team was to develop a cloud retrieval algorithm suite that is applied only to the common MODIS and VIIRS spectral channels. The suite uses heritage algorithms that produce the existing MODIS cloud mask (MOD35), MODIS cloud optical and microphysical properties (MOD06), and NOAA AWG/CLAVR-x cloud-top property products. Global monthly results from this hybrid algorithm suite (referred to as MODAWG) will be shown. Collocated CALIPSO comparisons will be shown that can independently evaluate inter-instrument product consistency for a subset of the MODAWG datasets.",

Nanopatterned arrays of biomolecules can offer unmatched sensitivity in molecular diagnostics. Furthermore, templated assembly of bio-inorganic structures at the nanoscale makes possible interesting quantum optical structures, including switchable photonic cavities. Here we describe different strategies to control the immobilization of single- and double-stranded DNA, as well as quantum dots, on nanopatterned surfaces, with features down to the sub-30nm regime. The bio-functional chemistry allows for the formation of non-sterically hindered DNA nanodomains where the dsDNA attached to the nanodots is accessible and maintains its native conformation, as confirmed by restriction enzymes studies at the single molecule level. We will further highlight the broader utility of such nanopatterned surfaces for the self-organization of quantum dots, demonstrating the ability to both biochemically and covalenty assemble single quantum dots on our nanopatterns.",

These are used to study part of the phase-diagram of the droplet in strong magnetic fields; we find evidence for a new phase in the spin polarized regime.

We have fabricated arrays of Au/Pd nano-dots using electron-beam and nanoimprint lithography. Different chemical strategies have been pursued to biofunctionalize such nanostructures, both through the formation of mixed Self Assembled Monolayers as well as via chemical reactions at surfaces.

Both instruments are characterized by vastly different spatial resolutions of 15m (ASTER) and 1000m (MODIS), respectively. Cloud optical thickness (τ) and effective droplet radius (reff) are derived by means of the Cross-platform HIgh resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system which yields MODIS-like cloud property retrievals via a shared-core architecture. The retrieval algorithm employs a standard bi-spectral retrieval scheme with two reflectances (ρ) in the visible to near-infrared spectral wavelength range (VNIR, 0.86μm) and shortwave infrared spectral wavelength range (SWIR, 2.1μm), respectively. For an exemplary granule the high-resolution ρ sampled by the ASTER instrument are aggregated from 15m to an increasingly coarse spatial resolution between (30-1000m). Subsequently, retrieved τ and reff from aggregated ρ are compared to the mean of the high-resolution cloud properties within the aggregated pixels. The differences in retrieved τ and reff are related to the sub-pixel covariance of ρ in the VNIR and SWIR band, as well as the inhomogeneity index (i.e., the ratio of standard deviation to mean value of ρ in the VNIR). This analysis highlights the impact of sub-pixel inhomogeneity and plane-parallel assumptions in the cloud property retrieval. CHIMAERA also allows for a comparison of ASTER and MODIS retrievals without introducing biases due to individual instrument algorithms. Retrieved τ and reff from the 1000m aggregated ρ sampled by ASTER are compared to the retrieved cloud properties provided by MODIS. The presented results highlight the different sensitivities of the ASTER and MODIS instruments and possible implications on data interpretation.",

      "abstract": "This work aims to study the changes in surface ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in a world of changing emissions and climate by focusing on India. Stakeholders in India are already aware about air quality issues but anthropogenic emissions are projected to largely increase for some of the pollutants in the short-term (2030) and medium-term (2050) futures in India, especially if no more policy efforts are made. Only the policies in place before 2014/15 have been taken into account while projecting the future emissions. Current policies have led to decrease in emission intensities, however may not be enough for control of absolute emissions in future. In this study, the regional EMEP/MSC-W chemical transport model is used forced by downscaled meteorological fields at a 50 km resolution following the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario. The reference scenario (for present-day) is evaluated with surface-based measurements. Given the relatively coarse resolution of the meteorological fields used for this comparison with urban observations, the agreement can be considered satisfactory as high correlations with O3 (r=0.9) and PM2.5 (r=0.5 and r=0.8 depending on the data set) are noticed. The bias in PM2.5 is limited (lower than 6%) but the model overestimates the O3 by 35%. Then, this work shows that in the 2050s, the variation in O3 linked to the climate change is mainly due to the change in O3 deposition velocity related to the change in the boundary layer height and, over a few areas, by changes in VOCs. At short term and medium-term, the PM2.5 is predicted to increase due to climate change, by up to 6.5% in the 2050s. This climatic variation is mainly explained by increases in dust, organic matter and secondary inorganic aerosols which are affected by the change in wind speed and precipitations. The large increase in anthropogenic emissions will modify the composition of PM2.5 over India as the secondary inorganic aerosols will be dominant. The surface PM2.5 concentrations will also reach huge levels in the 2030s and in the 2050s for the whole country.",

These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the Tropical Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling Experiment (TC4) conducted over Central America and surrounding Pacific and Atlantic Oceans between July 17 and August 8, 2007. Multispectral images in eight distinct bands were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud) over land and ocean ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of this cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds (liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). Finally, the cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both liquid water and ice clouds that were detected during each flight, using a nearly identical algorithm as that implemented operationally to process MODIS cloud data from the Aqua and Terra satellites (Collection 5). This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS and MASTER data in TC4, is quite capable of dis-tinguishing both liquid water and ice clouds during daytime conditions over both land and ocean. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals used three distinct bands of the MAS (or MASTER), and these results were com-pared with nearly simultaneous retrievals of MODIS on the Terra spacecraft. Fi-nally, this MODIS-based algorithm was adapted to MISR data to infer the cloud optical thickness of liquid water clouds from MISR. Results of this analysis will be presented and discussed.",

Using a novel strategy, based on identification of amino acid residues necessary for vitronectin protection of PAI-1 against inactivation by 4,4‧-dianilino-1,1‧-bisnaphthyl-5,5‧-disulfonic acid, we have defined a vitronectin binding surface spanning 10 residues between α-helix F, β-strand 2A, and α-helix E.

Due to developments in computing science and mathematics it becomes possible to integrate \"the best\" available knowledge and data to support the decision-maker in assessing the impacts of possible measures. However, present day facilities still require that these systems remain manageable in terms of turn around time, computer memory and development time. As a consequence of this, part of reality must be carved out and represented at such a time and space scale that the results are sufficiently accurate for the user of these systems. This leads to new research questions such as assessing the temporal and spatial resolution of the sub-systems, aggregation of processes on a longer time scale and determining the validity horizon of the systems. In this paper, these developments will be outlined based on a decision-support system for management of the Wadden Sea.",

Ternary phase equilibria were determined within an isothermal section at 1100 °C. For the Co-rich part (≥50 at.% Co) of the system, a liquidus surface projection and a corresponding Schulz-Scheil reaction scheme were constructed in combination with data for primary crystallization from as-cast samples determined by SEM and EPMA measurements. The crystal structures of novel ternary compounds have been elucidated by x-ray powder and single crystal diffraction and were supported by TEM. {Nb,Ta}CoB with NbCoB-type exhibits a high temperature modification (ZrAlNi-type, a = 0.5953 nm, c = 0.3248 nm; a = 0.5926 nm, c = 0.3247 nm for Nb and Ta respectively), which was only present in as-cast alloys, but found to be stabilized by the addition of Fe to annealing temperatures of 1400 °C. Ta<SUB>3</SUB>Co<SUB>4</SUB>B<SUB>7</SUB> (a = 0.3189 nm, b = 1.8333 nm, c = 0.8881 nm) was proven to be isotypic with Nb<SUB>3</SUB>Co<SUB>4</SUB>B<SUB>7</SUB>.

Substitution of Co by Ni stabilizes a smaller orthorhombic lattice with Re<SUB>3</SUB>B-type structure (Cmcm) although no homologue compound in the Ni-system exists. The crystallographic relations among the structure types of Re<SUB>3</SUB>B and pseudo-orthorhombic as well as monoclinic {Nb,Ta}Co<SUB>2</SUB>B were defined in terms of a Bärnighausen scheme.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in which OHPs were randomly assigned to a training program on the cognitions and perceptions of workers with a chronic disease (n = 29) or to a control group that did not receive training (n = 30). Participants received home assignments in which they had to identify the cognitions and perceptions of workers in video vignettes and had to indicate which interventions they would recommend to foster work participation. A generalized linear model repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to study the effects of the training program. The results of the analyses showed an increase in the ability to identify the cognitions and perceptions of workers of OHPs who received the training compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The results also showed an increased ability to recommend evidence-based interventions aimed at these cognitions and perceptions (p &lt; 0.001) as a result of participation in the training. The training program helps OHPs to identify cognitions and perceptions and to recommend evidence-based interventions. This can support them in their activities to increase the work participation of workers with a chronic disease.",

The derived amino acid sequences show between 34% and 55% identity when compared with legumins from angiosperms and from Pinaceae, respectively. The predicted precursors are unusual in that they contain potential glycosylation signals, and we have found the corresponding β-polypeptides actually to be glycosylated. As most outstanding feature one of the precursors is lacking the Asn-Gly processing site which has been assumed to be highly conserved in legumin gene evolution. Legumin encoding sequences amplified from genomic DNA suggest that these unusual precursors are widespread if not ubiquitous in the Taxodiaceae family. From previous reports on legumin precursors with divergent processing sites, on the proteases involved in legumin precursor processing and from the results presented here it is concluded that the Asn-Gly processing site has been acquired rather than conserved during legumin gene evolution.",

Conditions for control in water management are: aconsistent policy, gaining support and an adequate informationsupply. It is demonstrated that the balance between these three conditions of control depends on the type of water managementconsidered. In this paper four different types of water management are distinguished based on the conditions for control.The concept presented in this paper is validated on basis of three case studies. The paper concludes with a presentation of an approach which is interactive and aims at an integral and sustainable development.",

Two hundred and twenty IPs were asked to participate in a nationwide implementation study. A context analysis identified the barriers and promoting factors for the implementation. Then, participants were asked to assess, identify and report the factors that hinder or promote return to work (RTW) of employees on long-term sick leave using the checklist during six work ability assessments in daily practice. The outcome measure was the percentage of IPs that used the checklist in at least three of six work ability assessments. The use of the checklist was defined as the assessment of at least one of nine factors from the checklist. A frequency analysis was performed. Official work ability assessment records were analysed to determine whether the IPs reported the assessed factors. Most identified barriers and facilitators were related to the potential users, the work environment and the characteristics of the checklist. The implementation goal was achieved. A total of 79 IPs participated. Almost all the IPs (96 %) assessed at least one factor; 89 % used the checklist in at least 3 work ability assessments. An analysis of 474 official work ability assessment records indicated that 90 % of the IPs reported at least one of the factors. The implementation of a checklist to assess barriers and facilitators for RTW of long-term sick-listed employees was successful.",

The information about the rotational motion of the methyl groups, obtained by nuclear relaxation and heat-capacity measurements, is discussed and compared with neutron-scattering results. The entropy of the system is shown to be directly related to the value of the high-temperature barrier ( V<SUB>3</SUB>/ k = 160 K). The proton relaxation rate in the high-temperature phase is dependent on transitions between a number of levels, closely separated in energy. As a result one has to expect an almost zero value of the activation energy, as is found experimentally. For this phase NMR, neutron-scattering and heat-capacity data are in agreement. For the low-temperature barrier, the neutron-scattering result is at the lower end of the range, set by the heat-capacity data. In this case NMR possibly probes a fast relaxing minority of the methyl groups with a barrier, which is higher than that felt by the majority.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we examined the potential impacts of predicted climatic changes on the flora and vegetation in Denmark using data from a digital database on the natural vegetation of Europe. Climate scenarios A2 and B2 were used to find regions with present climatic conditions similar to Denmark's climate in the year 2100. The potential natural vegetation of Denmark today is predominantly deciduous forest that would cover more than 90% of the landscape. Swamps, bogs, and wet forest would be found under moist or wet conditions. Dwarf shrub heaths would be naturally occurring on poor soils along the coast together with dune systems and salt-marsh vegetation. When comparing the natural vegetation of Denmark to the vegetation of five future-climate analogue areas, the most obvious trend is a shift from deciduous to thermophilous broadleaved forest currently found in Southern and Eastern Europe. A total of 983 taxa were recorded for this study of which 539 were found in Denmark. The Sørensen index was used to measure the floristic similarity between Denmark and the five subregions. Deciduous forest, dwarf shrub heath, and coastal vegetation were treated in more detail, focusing on potential new immigrant species to Denmark. Finally, implications for management were discussed. The floristic similarity between Denmark and regions in Europe with a climate similar to what is expected for Denmark in year 2100 was found to vary between 48-78%, decreasing from North to South. Hence, it seems inevitable that climate changes of the magnitudes foreseen will alter the distribution of individual species and the composition of natural vegetation units. Changes, however, will not be immediate. Historic evidence shows a considerable lag in response to climatic change under natural conditions, but little is known about the effects of human land-use and pollution on this process. Facing such uncertainties we suggested that a dynamic strategy based on modeling, monitoring and adaptive management is adopted. Modeling techniques can be constantly improved, but will never be perfect and should therefore be linked to a fine-masked network of observatories to check model predictions and feed empirical data back into the models for calibration and further development.",

A significant limitation due to a previous lack of direct measurements motivates an evaluation of satellite observed IOT products. Recent advancements in geo-stationary capabilities with the launch of next generation imagers such as the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and the Japanese Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) provide new opportunities to leverage ground-based measurements due to the greatly increased sampling over individual sites compared to LEO. In this study, we utilize data collected by the University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) during the NASA KORUS-AQ in Seoul South Korea, the CAMP2Ex mission based in Manila Philippines, the ONR ship based PISTON campaign in the South West Pacific, and data collected in Madison WI to evaluate IOT from a beta version of the MODIS/CLDPROP and the NOAA CLAVR-x IR/optical retrievals processed on AHI/ABI data. An ice cloud detection algorithm is developed for the HSRL instrument capable of accurate detection and measurements of ice properties including direct measurements of IOT. Direct comparisons of the IOT retrievals with the HSRL over multiple months of observation will be presented with a focus on investigating systematic biases in the satellite retrievals and the impact of regional ice crystal morphology.",

However, integrating photodetectors in highly scaled ICs technologies is challenging due to the efficiency-speed trade-off. Here, we report a scalable and CMOS-compatible approach for an ultra-scaled germanium (Ge) based photodetector with tunable polarity. The photodetector is composed of a Ge Schottky barrier field effect transistor with monolithic aluminum (Al) source/drain contacts, offering plasmon assisted and polarization-resolved photodetection.

      "abstract": "Advances in microfabrication technology have made possible the production of structures with ever decreasing dimensions. As the size of these structures approaches certain characteristic lengths, quantum mechanical effects become evident. Electron interference phenomena may be observed in systems whose size is on the order of the electorn phase coherence length, l sub phi (which can be 1 micron or more at 1 K). For a wire of width less than l sub phi, the interference of electron partial waves which are elastically scattered by impurities leads to one-dimensional localization. This effect manifests itself in the form of a small correction to the low temperature residual resistance. For ring structures of diameter of approximately l sub phi, electron quantum interference leads to oscillations in the magnetoresistance of the ring with periods h/e and h/2e. These oscillations are the solid state analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Experimental studies of these quantum interference effects in ultrasmall metal wires and rings fabricated by high resolution microlithographic techniques are reviewed. The mechanisms which determine electron energy and phase relaxation in these systems, as determined from these effects, are also discussed. These relaxation mechanisms may be relevant for new classes of semiconductor devices, such as the hot electron transistor.",

      "abstract": "The launch of VIIRS and CrIS on Suomi NPP in the fall of 2011 introduced the next generation of U.S. operational polar orbiting environmental observations. Similar to MODIS, VIIRS provides visible and IR observations at moderate spatial resolution and has a 1:30 pm equatorial crossing time consistent with the MODIS on Aqua platform. However unlike MODIS, VIIRS lacks water vapor and CO2 absorbing channels that are used by the MODIS cloud algorithms for both cloud detection and to retrieve cloud top height and cloud emissivity for ice clouds. Given the different spectral and spatial characteristics of VIIRS, we seek to understand the extent to which the 15-year MODIS climate record can be continued with VIIRS/CrIS observations while maintaining consistent sensitivities across the observational systems. This presentation will focus on the evaluation of the latest version of the NASA funded cloud retrieval algorithms being developed for climate research. We will present collocated inter-comparisons between the imagers (VIIRS and MODIS Aqua) with CALIPSO and Cloud Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar observations as well as long term statistics based on a new Level-3 (L3) product being developed as part the project. The CALIPSO inter-comparisons will focus on cloud detection (cloud mask) with a focus on the impact of recent modifications to the cloud mask and how these changes impact the global statistics. For the first time we will provide inter-comparisons between two different cloud lidar systems (CALIOP and CATS) and investigate how the different sensitivities of the lidars impact the cloud mask and cloud comparisons. Using CALIPSO and CATS as the reference, and applying the same algorithms to VIIRS and MODIS, we will discuss the consistency between products from both imagers. The L3 analysis will focus on the regional and seasonal consistency between the suite of MODIS and VIIRS continuity cloud products. Do systematic biases remains when using consistent algorithms but applied to different observations (MODIS or VIIRS)?",

      "abstract": "While lithography tooling continues to advance to achieve the resolution and overlay requirements of most advanced devices, resist science, and technology proceed with material advancements and process enhancements to ultimately achieve the sensitivity and contrast required. In this paper, we report approaches of modifying a single layer resist system to achieve the characteristics of a bilayer resist system without the complexity of a multilayer process.The top surface of the single layer resist is made less sensitive to electron beam exposure and development effects. One of the methods used consists of desensitizing the top surface of a positive resist which operates on the chemical amplification principle, prior to exposure. The desensitization step is achieved by controlling the post-apply bake condition during resist film preparation. Proper bake control of this resist provides the exposed regions with an initial dissolution rate which is three times slower than that in the resist bulk. This surface modification process forms a thin layer of augmented resist that is less sensitive to beam interaction. Linewidth control is enhanced by delayed lateral erosion of the resist patterns. Very high resolution images are delineated using one development step which eliminates the complexity of a multilayer resist process. While scattering effects through the resist bulk are essentially unchanged, the beam resist interaction on the top surface is greatly altered. The slow dissolution rate in the top surface relative to the resist bulk results in a higher resist contrast and a more controllable process. Moreover, this technique provices a system with very little resist bias and leads to significant advantages as dimensions shrink. These contrast enhancement techniques and possible mechanisms for the relatively slow dissolution of the resist surface are related to image edge acuity. Using these techniques on single layer resist systems, subquarter micron dimensions have been obtained with good linewidth control which is much enhanced and less complex as compared to the multilayer resist processes.",

Using the cutting-edge fabrication technology, we fabricated small-period triangular antidot lattices with different honeycomb lattice periods (35 nm to 45 nm) and various AG potentials. The M-point gap, which reveals key characteristics of the AG band structure, was measured by intersubband excitations using resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) at low temperature. We found that the M-point gap could be tuned from 0.5 meV to 1.2 meV, with the band dispersion near the M point evolving from the Dirac-like case to flat band. Emerging flat-band physics in such tunable system will be discussed. <P />(*) Supported by Awards DOE_BES DE-SC0010695, and NSF-DMR-1306976.",

The multilayer detection algorithm is designed to provide a means of assessing the applicability of 1D cloud models used in the MODIS cloud optical and microphysical product retrieval, which are generated at a 1 km resolution. In order to investigate further the performance of the multilayer cloud detection algorithm we have run a set of forward models of multilayer clouds of varying layer separation, thermodynamic phase, optical and microphysical properties and varying surface and atmospheric conditions using the DISORT radiative transfer code. The model output, in the form of equivalent reflectances in the MODIS bands is then used as input to the operational MODIS cloud optical and microphysical properties retrieval algorithm and results are compared to the known truth of the DISORT input. We will present the results of this investigation with an emphasis on the applicability and skill of the MODIS multilayer cloud detection algorithm.",

[2004] examine the effect of overlying absorbing aerosol layers on cloud retrievals from satellite-measured reflectance and suggest that retrieved cloud optical depth and liquid water path are subject to systematic low bias when aerosol influences are excluded. Retrievals of cloud effective radius were found to be subject to either high or low bias, depending upon the radiance wavelength pair used in the retrieval, and the type of aerosol layer (biomass burning aerosol, or mineral dust) overlying the cloud. This study, although specific to satellites, raises the question that an understanding of how aerosols affect cloud retrievals of effective radius and optical depth from any remote sensing instrument is important when quantifying aerosol indirect effects. We made spectral measurements of upward and downward irradiance with the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) during the New England Air Quality Study - Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation (NEAQS-ITCT) onboard the Sky Research Jetstream (J-31) aircraft. These irradiance measurements are used in conjunction with a SSFR-specific radiative transfer model to retrieve cloud effective radius and optical depth in the presence and absence of overlying aerosol layers, as measured by the Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS-14) integrated onboard the same aircraft. We show cloud retrieval results for two days: 15th July, and 20th July 2004, where SSFR measurements were made between cloud and aerosol layers, and then above both the cloud and aerosol layers. Comparisons of retrieved cloud optical depth and effective radius are shown between the SSFR and coincident overpasses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument onboard the NASA-EOS Terra and Aqua satellites. We examine the effects of aerosols on SSFR cloud retrievals by including aerosols in case-specific forward models. For these two dates, neglecting aerosols in the SSFR forward model led to negligible difference in retrieved cloud optical depth, but cloud effective radius was larger than when aerosol particles were included. We also examine the sensitivity of the cloud retrievals to assumptions made in aerosol single scattering albedo.",

Most of these important parameters for radiative budget studies are derived from satellite radiance measurements (e.g. MODIS), others such as flux divergence are not. Aircraft spectral irradiance measurements offers the possibility to validate satellite retrievals and to examine the relationship between radiance measurements (made by satellites) to those of irradiance, the fundamental quantity of the radiative energy budget. We test the ability of radiative transfer models (both 1 and 3-D) and asymptotic theory to recreate spectral cloud albedo measurements from radiance measurements. Finally, spectral flux divergence, is compared to model calculations for both low level liquid water clouds and for high level ice clouds. The possible influence of aerosols on cloud radiative properties is highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Sustaining the functionality of drinking water supplies in low- and middle-income countries is a longstanding challenge. Growing awareness of this problem has motivated increased attention to validly and reliably measuring water point functionality, including among handpumps, which serve approximately 9 % of the global population. Yet the most widely used indicator of functionality, whether a water point provides water, has limited validity, reliability, and utility. We tested the inter-rater (agreement among measurements taken by different people) and intra-rater (agreement among repeated measurements taken by the same person) reliability of three handpump functionality field tests in Uganda: pump capacity, 10-minute leakage rate, and flowrate. One person equipped with a stopwatch and a 20-liter container can complete the tests for one handpump in 15 min. The same three to four raters each conducted the tests three times on 28 handpumps. Different sets of four to five raters each conducted the tests once on 32 handpumps. Intraclass correlation coefficients were estimated to indicate inter- and intra-rater reliability. Ten-minute leakage rate had the highest inter-rater reliability, followed by pump capacity. Flowrate, which is commonly measured manually as part of handpump functionality assessments, had poor inter-rater reliability. Indicators derived from all three tests had high intra-rater reliability. Drawing on our inter-rater reliability results, we propose a fully quantitative procedure and validate an ordinal scale of physical handpump functionality based on the 10-minute leakage rate and pump capacity tests. This measurement procedure can be usefully incorporated into service delivery monitoring and research to enhance the objectivity, utility, and comparability of global handpump functionality data. Future studies can test the reliability of these indicators in other contexts and their value for predicting handpump breakdown.",
