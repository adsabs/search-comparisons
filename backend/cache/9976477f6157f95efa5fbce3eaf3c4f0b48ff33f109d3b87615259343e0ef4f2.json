The families provide a unique view of catastrophic disruption phenomena and have been in the focus of planetary scientists for more than a century. Most of them are located in the main belt, a ring of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. Here we review the basic properties of the families, discuss some recent advances, and anticipate future challenges. This review pays more attention to dynamic aspects such as family identification, age determination, and long-term evolution. The text, however, goes beyond that. Especially, we cover the details of young families that see the major advances in the last years, and we anticipate it will develop even faster in the future. We also discuss the relevance of asteroid families for water-ice content in the asteroid belt and our current knowledge on links between families and main-belt comets. query Please check the edit made in the article title.",

Mine Project Value Curve Project Value as a function of mineral resource confidence, and associated terrestrial industry terms. Executive Summary The study of asteroids as a way to understand Solar System origins and dynamic evolution is accelerating with recent science missions including OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa 2 and soon to be launched missions including Psyche, Lucy, DART, MMX and Janus. Simultaneously there has been a rapid growth of activity around ​using the vast resources of the asteroids. Many of the science mission results also contribute to understanding these objects as potential orebodies. A significant opportunity for synergy between pure research and asteroid resource research has opened up, with pure and applied research each benefiting from the other. This white paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization, and highlights where further research can help accelerate the closing of science knowledge gaps, leading to the utilization of asteroid resources for growing economic productivity in space. Asteroid Resources Asteroid Resources are vast. The iron in the Main Belt has some 10 million times the known resources on Earth . Water and other volatiles, as well as precious metals, are also abundant 1 among the asteroids. For a long time, though, the prospect of actually harnessing these resources has seemed remote. Now “Mining the Sky” is no longer seen as a fantasy, but as a realistic, though challenging, enterprise. Starting about a decade ago, there have been a number of well-publicized start-ups with asteroid mining as their goal: Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, TransAstra and others. These commercial pursuits have been supplemented by a space-resource focused degree program at the Colorado School of Mines, and graduate seminars at the University of Central Florida, among others. The near-term hurdles are mostly financial. Development of the necessary technology needs too long a horizon (>5 years) for most investors. The US government has often brought down risk for entrepreneurs by investing in new technology . NASA is already supporting asteroid 2 resource activities via the SBIR and NIAC programs . Keeping in mind that NASA is charged to 3 “​seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space” , 4 and its strategic goal #3: “Address national challenges and catalyze economic growth” , support 5 of asteroid mining perfectly fits NASA’s mandate. More directly, Planetary Science will directly benefit from asteroid resource utilization. The same technologies developed for asteroid resource use will also bring great benefits to planetary science by enabling many more deep 1 “Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets”, John S.

      "abstract": "On November 25, 2015, the President of the United States (US) signed into law the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. This event received extensive coverage, both in the press and legal literature, mostly due to the content of its Title IV dedicated to Space Resource Exploration and Utilization. Pursuant to Title IV, US citizens shall be entitled under US law to collect, own, transport and sell asteroid and space resources that they have obtained in the course of resource recovery operations. Considering that international space law does not clarify whether space resources can be appropriated and used for commercial purposes, the enactment of the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act has been deemed by some commentators to amount to a breach of the international obligations of the US. In light of this controversy, the purpose of the present paper is to assess the consistency of the Act with international space law and to discuss the legal and political implications related to its adoption and (future) implementation.",

      "abstract": "\n Background This study assessed the feasibility and results of revisional bariatric surgery at a low-volume unit.Methods This retrospective study was conducted from January 2017 to August 2020; the revision group comprised patients treated for weight regain (WR, n = 6), insufficient weight loss (IWL, n =3), and various complications (n=6). Clinical characteristics and 30-day outcomes were assessed and compared with those of primary bariatric procedures (control, n=173). Results A total of 8.0% (15/188) of patients underwent revisional procedures and tended to be elderly (40.1 vs. 38.2 years), be female (73.3% vs. 54.9%), and have a significantly lower body mass index (33.1 vs. 39.9 kg/m2) and fewer comorbidities than controls. Gastric bypass was the most prevalent revisional procedure. A significantly longer operative duration (155 and 96 min; p < 0.001), longer length of stay (3.7 and 2.4 days) and higher 30-day complication rate (20.0% vs. 4.6%) were found in the revision group, including one case of leakage and another of jejunojejunostomy obstruction. There were no cases of conversion to open surgery or mortality. A total of 5/6 WR patients achieved excessive weight loss >50%, versus only one IWL patient who reached this goal. Complications, including marginal ulcer, fistula and post-sleeve gastrectomy stenosis, were alleviated after revision.Conclusion Revisional surgery appears to be feasible and effective in a low-volume practice in patients with WR and complications after primary bariatric procedures; however, the benefits should be weighed against the risks. More robust evidence is required to support ongoing practice.",
