      "abstract": "We have fabricated single-wall carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) in a conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) structure, with gate electrodes above the conduction channel separated from the channel by a thin dielectric. These top gate devices exhibit excellent electrical characteristics, including steep subthreshold slope and high transconductance, at gate voltages close to 1 V—a significant improvement relative to previously reported CNFETs which used the substrate as a gate and a thicker gate dielectric. Our measured device performance also compares very well to state-of-the-art silicon devices. These results are observed for both p- and n-type devices, and they suggest that CNFETs may be competitive with Si MOSFETs for future nanoelectronic applications.",

So far the investigations revealed that principally stainless steel covered with a thin coating is suitable as material for bipolar plates in PEM fuel cells. Cell performance is the same as in PEM fuel cells with graphite bipolar plates. Concerning the cost it has to be considered that not only the material itself but also the coating process has to be evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) has been performing model calculations in support of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. <BR /> Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. <BR /> In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at &lt;a href=\"www.emep.int\"target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.emep.int&lt;/a&gt;, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe.",

Reproducible and accurately periodic oscillations of the conductance with changing density are found to correspond to the sequential addition of single electrons to the segment of the channel between the barriers. Detailed examination of the line shape of the conductance versus density provides a new insight into the transport mechanism.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses uncertainties pertaining to damage assessments made for the floodings of the Meuse River in 1993 and 1995. The analysis is based on flood damage data that were collected by damage experts and consist of large sample sizes within each municipality. The most interesting aspect of these two floods is that although the volume of flooding and the inundated area were comparable in order of magnitude, the flood damage estimates in 1995 were 35% lower than in 1993. We conclude that part of the reduction in flood damage during the 1995 flood was due to a reduction in the damage to household goods. This may be explained by a marginal increase in flood warning time and experiences gained from the flood of 1993. As flood damage assessments are the cornerstone in the evaluation of flood damage mitigation schemes, empirical data of previous floods should be used to improve the foundations of the methods to assess flood damages.",

      "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.",

In doped SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> single crystals, we found a dc-current-induced reversible insulator-conductor transition with resistance changes of up to five orders of magnitude. This conducting state allows extremely reproducible switching between different impedance states by current pulses with a performance required for nonvolatile memories. The results indicate a type of charge-induced bulk electronic change as a prerequisite for the memory effect, scaling down to nanometer-range electrode sizes in thin films.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over a \"receptor\" region to emission changes over a foreign \"source\" region is key to evaluating the potential gains from an international approach to abate ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) pollution. We apply an ensemble of 21 global and hemispheric chemical transport models to estimate the spatial average surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over east Asia (EA), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and south Asia (SA) to 20% decreases in anthropogenic emissions of the O<SUB>3</SUB> precursors, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO (individually and combined), from each of these regions. We find that the ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations in the base case (year 2001) simulation matches available observations throughout the year over EU but overestimates them by &gt;10 ppb during summer and early fall over the eastern United States and Japan. The sum of the O<SUB>3</SUB> responses to NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental-scale \"import sensitivity\" as the ratio of the O<SUB>3</SUB> response to the 20% reductions in foreign versus \"domestic\" (i.e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0.6 ppb over EU (0.4 ppb from NA), less than the 0.8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0.7. The ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0.7-0.9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0.8-1.6 ppb). High O<SUB>3</SUB> values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0.2 to 0.3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O<SUB>3</SUB> levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8-h average O<SUB>3</SUB> above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region (&lt;10-20% of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50% of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O<SUB>3</SUB> of about 0.1 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP>, at the low end of the 0.1-0.5 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP> derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20% reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O<SUB>3</SUB> response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20% reductions of anthropogenic NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign source region.",
