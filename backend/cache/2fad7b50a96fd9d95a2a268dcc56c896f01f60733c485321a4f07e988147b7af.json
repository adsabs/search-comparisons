The families provide a unique view of catastrophic disruption phenomena and have been in the focus of planetary scientists for more than a century. Most of them are located in the main belt, a ring of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. Here we review the basic properties of the families, discuss some recent advances, and anticipate future challenges. This review pays more attention to dynamic aspects such as family identification, age determination, and long-term evolution. The text, however, goes beyond that. Especially, we cover the details of young families that see the major advances in the last years, and we anticipate it will develop even faster in the future. We also discuss the relevance of asteroid families for water-ice content in the asteroid belt and our current knowledge on links between families and main-belt comets. query Please check the edit made in the article title.",

      "abstract": "\n \n \n Differentiation of narcolepsy type II (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is challenging in clinical practice. Diagnostic criteria rely on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), previously shown to have poor reproducibility in these disorders. We leveraged a large polysomnographic database to study test-retest reliability in non-cataplectic central hypersomnia disorders.\n \n \n \n Patients evaluated at Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center from 2008-2021 with suspected central hypersomnia disorders excluding narcolepsy type I with >1 PSG/MSLT were included. Studies not meeting validity criteria (< 7hr sleep time on PSG, < 5 MSLT trials, use of REM suppressants/alerting medications within 14 days) were excluded. Diagnostic groupings included NT2, IH and Normal/Indeterminate based on ICSD-3. Reliability and correlation between tests was performed using intra-class and Spearman’s correlations, respectively. Data is presented as mean+SD or median [25th,75th percentiles] for continuous variables and N(%) for categorical variables.\n \n \n \n A total of 58 patients (62.1% female, age 31.9 yr [18.5, 48.6]) were included. Interval between MSLTs was 3.6 + 3.18 yr (same diagnosis on both tests: 3.24 + 3.15; changed diagnosis: 3.98 + 3.22). Diagnosis based on MSLT 1 was NT2 8(13.8%), IH 20(34.5%) and Normal/Indeterminate 30(51.7%). Overall, 33(56.9%) patients remained in the same diagnostic category including 3(5.2%) NT2, 12(20.7%) IH and 18(31.0 %) Normal/Indeterminate. Of 25(43.1%) cases changing diagnosis, 3(5.2%) changed from NT2 to IH and 2(3.4%) to Normal/Indeterminate; 4(6.9%) changed from IH to NT2 and 4(6.9%) to Normal/Indeterminate; 5(8.6%) changed from Normal/Indeterminate to NT2 and 7(12.1%) to IH. Median MSL on tests 1 and 2 were 10.8 [4.6,12.9] and 9.0 [4.5,13.1], respectively. Correlation was moderate MSL [0.59 (0.39, 0.73), p< 0.001] and fair for SOREMPs [0.32 (0.07, 0.53), p=0.015]. Intra-class correlation showed moderate reliability in test-retest for MSL [0.56 (0.36, 0.72)] and SOREMPs [0.54 (0.33, 0.70)].\n \n \n \n MSLT test-retest reproducibility in non-cataplectic central hypersomnias was moderate in a tertiary care clinic population. While more favorable than prior studies, these findings underscore diagnostic challenges that may contribute to misdiagnosis of patients with hypersomnia.\n \n \n \n  \n",

      "abstract": "A significant opportunity for synergy between pure research and asteroid resource research exists. We provide an overview of the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization, and highlight where we can accelerate the closing of knowledge gaps, leading to the utilization of asteroid resources for growing economic productivity in space. Mine Project Value Curve Project Value as a function of mineral resource confidence, and associated terrestrial industry terms. Executive Summary The study of asteroids as a way to understand Solar System origins and dynamic evolution is accelerating with recent science missions including OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa 2 and soon to be launched missions including Psyche, Lucy, DART, MMX and Janus. Simultaneously there has been a rapid growth of activity around ​using the vast resources of the asteroids. Many of the science mission results also contribute to understanding these objects as potential orebodies. A significant opportunity for synergy between pure research and asteroid resource research has opened up, with pure and applied research each benefiting from the other. This white paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization, and highlights where further research can help accelerate the closing of science knowledge gaps, leading to the utilization of asteroid resources for growing economic productivity in space. Asteroid Resources Asteroid Resources are vast. The iron in the Main Belt has some 10 million times the known resources on Earth . Water and other volatiles, as well as precious metals, are also abundant 1 among the asteroids. For a long time, though, the prospect of actually harnessing these resources has seemed remote. Now “Mining the Sky” is no longer seen as a fantasy, but as a realistic, though challenging, enterprise. Starting about a decade ago, there have been a number of well-publicized start-ups with asteroid mining as their goal: Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, TransAstra and others. These commercial pursuits have been supplemented by a space-resource focused degree program at the Colorado School of Mines, and graduate seminars at the University of Central Florida, among others. The near-term hurdles are mostly financial. Development of the necessary technology needs too long a horizon (>5 years) for most investors. The US government has often brought down risk for entrepreneurs by investing in new technology . NASA is already supporting asteroid 2 resource activities via the SBIR and NIAC programs . Keeping in mind that NASA is charged to 3 “​seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space” , 4 and its strategic goal #3: “Address national challenges and catalyze economic growth” , support 5 of asteroid mining perfectly fits NASA’s mandate. More directly, Planetary Science will directly benefit from asteroid resource utilization. The same technologies developed for asteroid resource use will also bring great benefits to planetary science by enabling many more deep 1 “Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets”, John S.

      "abstract": "On November 25, 2015, the President of the United States (US) signed into law the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. This event received extensive coverage, both in the press and legal literature, mostly due to the content of its Title IV dedicated to Space Resource Exploration and Utilization. Pursuant to Title IV, US citizens shall be entitled under US law to collect, own, transport and sell asteroid and space resources that they have obtained in the course of resource recovery operations. Considering that international space law does not clarify whether space resources can be appropriated and used for commercial purposes, the enactment of the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act has been deemed by some commentators to amount to a breach of the international obligations of the US. In light of this controversy, the purpose of the present paper is to assess the consistency of the Act with international space law and to discuss the legal and political implications related to its adoption and (future) implementation.",

      "abstract": "Study carried out at Laboratório de Cirurgia Experimental, Universidade do Estado do Pará – UEPA, Belém, PA, Brasil. Summary: Purpose: To assess the importance of the title structure on the citation rate in Brazilian literature. Methods: All the original research articles published in five Brazilian medical journals were analyzed. The numbers of citations of each article was retrieved from Google Scholar and each title was placed into one of the three groups: 1) titles describing the research methods/ design (methods-describing title); 2) titles describing the results/conclusions (results-describing title); and 3) titles that were nonclassifiable. Number of words and characters; reference to a geographical area; use of a hyphen or colon; mentioning of drugs; and description of study design were extracted. Results: There were 442 (88.4%) methods-describing titles, 43 (8.6%) resultsdescribing titles, and 15 (3%) questions titles. The number of citations for the group 1 was significantly less than the number of citations for group 2 and group 3 articles (p<0.05). There were no correlations between the number of characters and words in the title and the numbers of citations. Titles referring to a specific geographical region were significantly more cited than titles that did not reference a geographical region. Conclusion: The structure proposing a question, along with the results-describing titles were found to be relevant for a high citation rate nationally since it facilitates the literature review. The presence of a specific geographical location on the title also proved to be significant probably due to a great regionalization of diseases in Brazil.",

      "abstract": "From Space debris to asteroid strikes to anti-satellite weapons, humanity's rapid expansion into Space raises major environmental, safety, and security challenges. In this book, Michael Byers and Aaron Boley, an international lawyer and an astrophysicist, identify and interrogate these challenges and propose actionable solutions. They explore essential questions from, 'How do we ensure all of humanity benefits from the development of Space, and not just the world's richest people?' to 'Is it possible to avoid war in Space?' Byers and Boley explain the essential aspects of Space science, international law, and global governance in a fully transdisciplinary and highly accessible way. Addressing the latest and emerging developments in Space, they equip readers with the knowledge and tools to engage in current and critically important legal, policy, and scientific debates concerning the future development of Space.
