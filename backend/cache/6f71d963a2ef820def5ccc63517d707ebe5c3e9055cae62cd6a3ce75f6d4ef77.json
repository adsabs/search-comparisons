Reproducible and accurately periodic oscillations of the conductance with changing density are found to correspond to the sequential addition of single electrons to the segment of the channel between the barriers. Detailed examination of the line shape of the conductance versus density provides a new insight into the transport mechanism.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) has been performing model calculations in support of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. <BR /> Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km Ã— 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. <BR /> In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at &lt;a href=\"www.emep.int\"target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.emep.int&lt;/a&gt;, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.",

In doped SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> single crystals, we found a dc-current-induced reversible insulator-conductor transition with resistance changes of up to five orders of magnitude. This conducting state allows extremely reproducible switching between different impedance states by current pulses with a performance required for nonvolatile memories.

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Understanding the surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over a \"receptor\" region to emission changes over a foreign \"source\" region is key to evaluating the potential gains from an international approach to abate ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) pollution. We apply an ensemble of 21 global and hemispheric chemical transport models to estimate the spatial average surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response over east Asia (EA), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and south Asia (SA) to 20% decreases in anthropogenic emissions of the O<SUB>3</SUB> precursors, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO (individually and combined), from each of these regions. We find that the ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations in the base case (year 2001) simulation matches available observations throughout the year over EU but overestimates them by &gt;10 ppb during summer and early fall over the eastern United States and Japan. The sum of the O<SUB>3</SUB> responses to NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental-scale \"import sensitivity\" as the ratio of the O<SUB>3</SUB> response to the 20% reductions in foreign versus \"domestic\" (i.e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0.6 ppb over EU (0.4 ppb from NA), less than the 0.8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0.7. The ensemble mean surface O<SUB>3</SUB> response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0.7-0.9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0.8-1.6 ppb). High O<SUB>3</SUB> values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0.2 to 0.3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O<SUB>3</SUB> levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8-h average O<SUB>3</SUB> above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region (&lt;10-20% of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50% of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O<SUB>3</SUB> of about 0.1 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP>, at the low end of the 0.1-0.5 ppb a<SUP>-1</SUP> derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20% reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O<SUB>3</SUB> response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20% reductions of anthropogenic NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign source region.",

Our measured device performance also compares very well to state-of-the-art silicon devices.

      "abstract": "The role of the adaptive immune response in controlling the growth and recurrence of human tumors has been controversial. We characterized the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in large cohorts of human colorectal cancers by gene expression profiling and in situ immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the immunological data (the type, density, and location of immune cells within the tumor samples) were found to be a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage colorectal cancer. The results were validated in two additional patient populations. These data support the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors. In situ analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells may therefore be a valuable prognostic tool in the treatment of colorectal cancer and possibly other malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Molecular electronics is often limited by the poorly defined nature of the contact between the molecules and the metal surface. We describe a method to wire molecules into gaps in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Precise oxidative cutting of a SWNT produces carboxylic acid-terminated electrodes separated by gaps of &lt;=10 nanometers. These point contacts react with molecules derivatized with amines to form molecular bridges held in place by amide linkages. These chemical contacts are robust and allow a wide variety of molecules to be tested electrically. In addition to testing molecular wires, we show how to install functionality in the molecular backbone that allows the conductance of the single-molecule bridges to switch with pH.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "We have investigated the electrical transport properties of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors as a function of channel length, gate dielectric film thickness, and dielectric material. Our experiments show that the bulk properties of the semiconducting carbon nanotubes do not limit the current flow through the metal/nanotube/metal system. Instead, our results can be understood in the framework of gate and source-drain field induced modulation of the nanotube band structure at the source contact. The existence of one-dimensional Schottky barriers at the metal/nanotube interface determines the device performance and results in an unexpected scaling behavior.",
