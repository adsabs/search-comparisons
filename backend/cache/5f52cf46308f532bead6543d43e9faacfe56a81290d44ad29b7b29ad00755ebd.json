      "abstract": "We have fabricated single-wall carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) in a conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) structure, with gate electrodes above the conduction channel separated from the channel by a thin dielectric. These top gate devices exhibit excellent electrical characteristics, including steep subthreshold slope and high transconductance, at gate voltages close to 1 V—a significant improvement relative to previously reported CNFETs which used the substrate as a gate and a thicker gate dielectric. Our measured device performance also compares very well to state-of-the-art silicon devices. These results are observed for both p- and n-type devices, and they suggest that CNFETs may be competitive with Si MOSFETs for future nanoelectronic applications.",

      "abstract": "Climate observations from the McMurdo dry valleys, East Antarctica are presented from a network of seven valley floor automatic meteorological stations during the period 1986 to 2000. Mean annual temperatures ranged from -14.8°C to -30.0°C, depending on the site and period of measurement. Mean annual relative humidity is generally highest near the coast. Mean annual wind speed increases with proximity to the polar plateau. Site-to-site variation in mean annual solar flux and PAR is due to exposure of each station and changes over time are likely related to changes in cloudiness. During the nonsummer months, strong katabatic winds are frequent at some sites and infrequent at others, creating large variation in mean annual temperature owing to the warming effect of the winds. Katabatic wind exposure appears to be controlled to a large degree by the presence of colder air in the region that collects at low points and keeps the warm less dense katabatic flow from the ground. The strong influence of katabatic winds makes prediction of relative mean annual temperature based on geographical position (elevation and distance from the coast) alone, not possible. During the summer months, onshore winds dominate and warm as they progress through the valleys creating a strong linear relationship (r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.992) of increasing potential temperature with distance from the coast (0.09°C km<SUP>-1</SUP>). In contrast to mean annual temperature, summer temperature lends itself quite well to model predictions, and is used to construct a statistical model for predicting summer dry valley temperatures at unmonitored sites.",

Cell performance is the same as in PEM fuel cells with graphite bipolar plates. Concerning the cost it has to be considered that not only the material itself but also the coating process has to be evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) has been performing model calculations in support of the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model is still one of the key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. <BR /> Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate photo-oxidants and both inorganic and organic aerosols. <BR /> In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at &lt;a href=\"www.emep.int\"target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.emep.int&lt;/a&gt;, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe.",

Detailed examination of the line shape of the conductance versus density provides a new insight into the transport mechanism.",

      "abstract": "A mesoscale atmospheric numerical model is coupled with a physically based snow-pack model and with a snow-drift model. The snow model is verified for the French Alps by comparing its simulations to observations performed at the Col de Porte in the Chartreuse Massif. The snow erosion threshold depends on snow-pack properties such as density, dendricity, sphericity and particle size. The atmospheric turbulence scheme is modified in order to take into account stabilization effects due to airborne blown snow particles. In particular, vertically integrated stability functions for the stable boundary layer are completed by including the threshold friction velocity for snow erosion. The snow-drift model is calibrated by simulating the conditions observed during the Byrd snow project, held in West Antarctica in 1962. Finally, sensitivity experiments to the snow-surface properties show the importance of their accurate representation when modelling the contribution of deflation to the Antarctic surface mass balance.",

The analysis is based on flood damage data that were collected by damage experts and consist of large sample sizes within each municipality. The most interesting aspect of these two floods is that although the volume of flooding and the inundated area were comparable in order of magnitude, the flood damage estimates in 1995 were 35% lower than in 1993. We conclude that part of the reduction in flood damage during the 1995 flood was due to a reduction in the damage to household goods. This may be explained by a marginal increase in flood warning time and experiences gained from the flood of 1993. As flood damage assessments are the cornerstone in the evaluation of flood damage mitigation schemes, empirical data of previous floods should be used to improve the foundations of the methods to assess flood damages.",

      "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized almost all natural language processing (NLP) tasks but suffer from memory and computational complexity that scales quadratically with sequence length. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.",

      "abstract": "A new model of katabatic winds is presented. A hydraulic approach is employed in which the detailed vertical structure of the flow is replaced by a quiescent stably stratified environment and an equivalent flowing layer which is subject to sustained layer cooling, surface stress and interfacial entrainment. A scaling which contains most of the parametric behavior is found. It shows that interfacial entrainment is the dominating retardation mechanism of the flow and that surface stress may be relatively unimportant.Steady solutions are presented to show that katabatic winds are essentially supercritical on all practical slopes (slope angles &gt;0.1°), and are affected by ambient stratification only at large distances. The model is in satisfactory quantitative agreement with the limited field data available.",

The gully flowand other drainage flows are generally eliminated in the middle of the night in conjunctionwith flow acceleration abovethe surface inversion layer and downwardmixing of warmer air and highermomentum. As the flow decelerates later inthe night, the gully flow may re-form. The thin drainage flows decouple standard observational levels of3-10 m from the surface.Under such common conditions, eddy correlationflux measurements cannot be used toestimate surface fluxes nor even detect thethin gully and drainage flows.

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds dramatically affect the climate of the McMurdo dry valleys, Antarctica. Winter wind events can increase local air temperatures by 30°C. The frequency of katabatic winds largely controls winter (June to August) temperatures, increasing 1°C per 1% increase in katabatic frequency, and it overwhelms the effect of topographic elevation (lapse rate). Summer katabatic winds are important, but their influence on summer temperature is less. The spatial distribution of katabatic winds varies significantly. Winter events increase by 14% for every 10 km up valley toward the ice sheet, and summer events increase by 3%. The spatial distribution of katabatic frequency seems to be partly controlled by inversions. The relatively slow propagation speed of a katabatic front compared to its wind speed suggests a highly turbulent flow. The apparent wind skip (down-valley stations can be affected before up-valley ones) may be caused by flow deflection in the complex topography and by flow over inversions, which eventually break down. A strong return flow occurs at down-valley stations prior to onset of the katabatic winds and after they dissipate. Although the onset and termination of the katabatic winds are typically abrupt, elevated air temperatures remain for days afterward. We estimate that current frequencies of katabatic winds increase annual average temperatures by 0.7° to 2.2°C, depending on location. Seasonally, they increase (decrease) winter average temperatures (relative humidity) by 0.8° to 4.2° (-1.8 to -8.5%) and summer temperatures by 0.1° to 0.4°C (-0.9% to -4.1%). Long-term changes of dry valley air temperatures cannot be understood without knowledge of changes in katabatic winds.",
