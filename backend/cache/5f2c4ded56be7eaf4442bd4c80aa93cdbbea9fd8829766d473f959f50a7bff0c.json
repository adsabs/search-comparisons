      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Our understanding of solar system evolution is closely tied to interpretations of asteroid composition, particularly the M-class asteroids. These asteroids were initially thought to be the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, a hypothesis based on their spectral similarity to iron meteorites. However, recent astronomical observations have revealed hydration on their surface through the detection of 3 μm absorption features associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O. We present evidence of hydration due mainly to OH on asteroid (16) Psyche, the largest M-class asteroid, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spanning 1.1–6.63 μm. Our observations include two detections of the full 3 μm feature associated with OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>O resembling those found in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites, and no 6 μm feature uniquely associated with H<SUB>2</SUB>O across two observations. We observe 3 μm depths of between 4.3% and 6% across two observations, values consistent with hydrogen abundance estimates on other airless bodies of 250–400 ppm. We place an upper limit of 39 ppm on the water abundance from the standard deviation around the 6 μm feature region. The presence of hydrated minerals suggests a complex history for Psyche. Exogenous sources of OH-bearing minerals could come from hydrated impactors. Endogenous OH-bearing minerals would indicate a composition more similar to E- or P-class asteroids. If the hydration is endogenous, it supports the theory that Psyche originated beyond the snow line and later migrated to the outer main belt.",

      "abstract": "Our understanding of Solar System evolution is intricately linked to the compositional analysis of asteroids, particularly the M-class asteroids. Originally believed to be the exposed metallic cores of differentiated planetesimals due to their spectral resemblance to iron meteorites, recent observations have challenged this view by revealing signs of hydration on their surfaces. These findings include the detection of 3-μm absorption features indicative of hydroxyl (OH) groups and possibly water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O). In our study, we utilize data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), covering the spectral range of 1.1 to 6.63 μm, to investigate the surface hydration of (16) Psyche, the largest known M-class asteroid and target of NASA's Psyche mission. Our analysis reveals two distinct instances of the complete 3-μm feature, commonly associated with OH and potentially H<SUB>2</SUB>O, resembling those observed in CY-, CH-, and CB-type carbonaceous chondrites. Conversely, we detected no unique 6-μm features that would indicate the presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>O. The observed 3-μm feature depths ranged from 4.3% to 6%, with hydrogen abundance estimates on similar airless bodies suggesting values between 250 and 400 ppm. We have established an upper limit of 39 ppm for water abundance based on the standard deviation around the 6-μm feature region. The detection of hydration on Psyche's surface suggests a complex history for Psyche, potentially involving both exogenous sources from hydrated impactors and/or processes that enabled Psyche to retain hydration during its formation. If the hydration is found to be endogenous, it supports the hypothesis that Psyche originated beyond the snow line before migrating to the outer main belt, thus indicating a composition more akin to E- or P-class asteroids. Additionally, we will be presenting new findings on whether the 3-μm feature varies across different locations on Psyche by conducting single spaxel sampling across its surface. These findings will provide additional evidence to distinguish between hypotheses for the source of Psyche's hydrated surface.",

      "abstract": "Our current understanding of Solar System evolution hinges on interpreting the history of the asteroids. M-type asteroids in particular potentially represent the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, but there is insufficient data to claim with certainty that these asteroids are purely metallic. Previous detections of hydration and phyllosilicates on their surfaces further complicate the assumed composition of these asteroids. We propose to observe (16) Psyche, the prototypical M-type asteroid and target of the upcoming NASA Discovery mission 'Psyche', to quantify the amount and variability of hydration present on (16) Psyche's surface and to unambiguously determine if the hydration is a result of hydroxyl or water molecules. Our program will obtain high SNR, high spectral resolution, near to mid-IR spectra of (16) Psyche to detect and contemporaneously observe the entire 3-micron and 6-micron absorption and emission bands attributed to hydroxyl and/or water, potentially uniquely identifying water for the first time. We propose to observe (16) Psyche with a total of two visits using the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instruments to obtain spectra from two, distinct hemispherical regions and thereby measure any global variability of the hydration features. JWST's unique capability to measure the entire 3 and 6-micron bands on the largest M-type asteroid will unambiguously identify the presence of water or hydroxyl on (16) Psyche, constraining (16) Psyche's surface composition and impact history, providing critical context for the upcoming 'Psyche' mission and interpretations of hydration features observed on asteroids.",

      "abstract": "We used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe Psyche, the prototypical M-type asteroid and target of the soon-to-launch NASA Discovery mission 'Psyche'. The observations were designed to assess the presence of hydration on Psyche's surface and to distinguish between any indications of hydration resulting from either hydroxyl or water molecules. Our program obtained high SNR (~200), high spectral resolution (~0.003 µm), near to mid-IR spectra (0.97 – 6.73 µm) of Psyche to detect the entire 3-µm and 6-µm absorption and emission bands attributed to hydroxyl and/or water. JWST's unique capability to measure the entire 3 and 6-µm bands enables us to constrain Psyche's surface composition and impact history, providing critical context for the upcoming 'Psyche' mission and interpretations of hydration features observed on asteroids. We observed Psyche with a total of two visits using the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instruments. The NIRSpec observations were separated by ~1/2 of Psyche's rotation period, and the MIRI observations were separated by 5 days with a ~70% offset in rotation period. Psyche was nearly pole-on during these observations, and therefore the two visits associated with each instrument are not anticipated to reveal significantly different portions of the asteroid's surface. However, we were able to resolve Psyche across ~10 pixels in diameter, enabling identification of compositional variability across a single hemisphere within each observation. We will present on the current state of our ongoing analysis of potential 3 and 6-µm features observed along with their variation across Psyche's surface, and speculate on the implications for Psyche's composition, origin and evolution, and the broader context of these findings as they relate to M-type asteroids and the evolution of the solar system.",

      "abstract": "Correlating the abundance of hydration on asteroids with their location in the asteroid belt can constrain conditions and subsequent evolution of the early solar system, with additional implications for how water was delivered to Earth. Hypotheses related to the distribution of hydration in the solar system can be tested by observing compositionally similar asteroids in different regions of the asteroid belt. A widely used method for determining hydration on asteroids is through the detection of an absorption band near 3 micron caused by the O-H fundamental stretching mode. The band center and shape of the 3 micron feature has implications for the type and abundance of asteroidal hydration. There is no way to distinguish the cause of the 3 micron feature (H2O, aqueously altered minerals, or a combination of both) without spectra at complementary wavelengths. The MIR spectral region offers an opportunity to disentangle the effects of H2O and aqueously altered minerals on asteroid surfaces. Molecular H2O and aqueously altered minerals have distinct spectral features across the MIR bandpass. The goal of this program is to use MIRI MRS and NIRSpec IFU to distinguish between water ice, aqueously altered minerals, or a combination of both as the compositional component(s) responsible for the 3 micron absorption. We will observe two asteroids that are representatives of two major groupings of asteroids defined by their 3 micron band shapes: (142) Polana and (225) Henrietta.

Both asteroids show similar spectral characteristics (i.e., UV drop off short of 0.4 µm, negative VIS slope) despite being located at opposite edges of the asteroid belt, making them ideal candidates for studies of the distribution of hydration in the solar system.

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The presence of hydrated minerals and/or water on asteroids has important implications for how they, and the Solar System, formed and evolved. Techniques that unambiguously detect water on asteroids can be used to identify targets for exploration and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and could be used to better understand how water was delivered to Earth. Asteroid hydration is typically determined through detections of the near-infrared (NIR) 3-micron absorption feature; however, interpretation of this spectral feature is complicated by the need for thermal corrections to NIR data, telluric lines in our atmosphere, and the proximity of the OH (2.8 microns) and H2O (3 microns) spectral absorption features. In the far-ultraviolet (FUV), however, water produces a strong spectral edge causing a significant difference in albedo shortward and longward of 165 nm. We propose to conduct observations of five M-type asteroids using the FUV COS G140L mode to 1) evaluate if the hydrated sub-class of the M-type asteroids are in fact hydrated or are otherwise different from the non-hydrated, presumably metallic M-types; and 2) determine if this hydration is due to OH or H2O, since only H2O is expected to produce the strong FUV spectral signature. Only three asteroids have ever been observed at wavelengths &lt;180 nm, so this proposed program would significantly increase the database of FUV asteroid observations while also verifying if the FUV can be used to unambiguously detect water or water-bearing minerals on asteroid surfaces.",

      "abstract": "We present a spectral analysis of unresolved spaxel data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for asteroid (16) Psyche, using a method adapted from Perna et al. (2023) to correct spectral artifacts, known as \"wiggles,\" caused by spatial undersampling and JWST's Point Spread Function (PSF). Our initial goal was to map water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O) and hydroxyl (OH) across Psyche's surface, but the data's unresolved nature prompted us to focus on refining the spectral quality. By applying Perna et al.'s method, we were able to largely correct the \"wiggles\" and recover cleaner spectra. This approach enhances our ability to interpret small-scale features and would allow for investigations into surface compositional variations with resolved data that have resolution constraints. This technique is widely applicable to JWST observations of small bodies and serves as a valuable tool in scenarios where high-resolution data is not available, offering new insights into planetary surfaces and their compositions.

      "abstract": "Small particles (μm to cm-size) in planetary ring systems and protoplanetary disks collide at low velocities (less than 1 m/s) and tend to aggregate through non-gravitational interactions. Additionally, exploration and sample return missions to asteroids and other small, airless bodies involve low energy interactions with weakly-bound regolith particles. Therefore, to characterize the processes that lead to planetesimal formation and planetary ring collisional evolution, and to develop appropriate procedures for asteroid sample return missions, it is necessary to understand how regolith responds to low-energy collisions in a microgravity environment. The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs produced observations of mass transfer of regolith onto cm-scale projectiles at impact velocities &lt; 40 cm/s in microgravity conditions. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. To study this phenomenon with significantly reduced cost and time constraints we have developed an experimental apparatus that makes use of a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s). The experiment consists of a tube pumped to vacuum conditions containing a cm-diameter marble suspended from a spring in contact with a bed of regolith. The spring contracts during free-fall allowing us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We are also carrying out concurrent numerical simulations with the use of a discrete element method particle simulation program, LIGGGHTS (Kloss et al. 2012, Prog. Comp. Fluid Dyn., 12, 140), to replicate these environmental conditions and study the role of cohesion in mass transfer events. We will present the results of our laboratory and numerical studies where we vary rebound velocity, target material type and grain size distribution, projectile size and material, and regolith packing density designed to bolster our understanding of collisional evolution in the protoplanetary disk and planetary rings.",

      "abstract": "The ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are fundamentally different from the gas giant and terrestrial planets. Though ice giants represent the most common size of exoplanet and possess characteristics that challenge our understanding of the way our solar system formed and evolved, they remain the only class of planetary object without a dedicated spacecraft mission. The inclusion of a Uranus orbiter as the third highest priority Flagship mission in the NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey \"Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022\" indicates a high level of support for exploration of the ice giants by the planetary science community. However, given the substantial costs associated with a flagship mission, it is critical to explore lower cost options if we intend to visit Uranus within an ideal launch window of 2029-2034 when a Jupiter gravity assist becomes available. In this paper, we describe the Quest to Uranus to Explore Solar System Theories (QUEST), a New Frontiers class Uranus orbiter mission concept study performed at the 30th Annual NASA/JPL Planetary Science Summer Seminar. The proposed QUEST platform is a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to undergo highly elliptical, polar orbits around Uranus during a notional one-year primary science mission. The proposed major science goals of the mission are (1) to use Uranus as a natural laboratory to better understand the dynamos that drive magnetospheres in the solar system and beyond and (2) to identify the energy transport mechanisms in Uranus' magnetic, atmospheric, and interior environments in contrast with the other giant planets. With substantial mass, power, and cost margins, this mission concept demonstrates a compelling, feasible option for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter mission.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The regolith covering the surfaces of asteroids and planetary satellites is very different from terrestrial soil particles and subject to environmental conditions very different from what is found on Earth. The loose, unconsolidated granular material has angular-shaped grains and a broad size distribution. On small and airless bodies (&lt;10 km), the solar wind leads to a depletion of fine grains (&lt;100µm) on the surface. Ground observations of the two asteroids currently targeted by spacecraft, Ryugu (Hayabusa-2) and Bennu (OSIRIS-REx), indicate that their surfaces could be covered in mm- to cm-sized regolith grains. As these small bodies have surface gravity levels below 10<SUP>-5</SUP>g, g being the Earth surface gravity, the cohesion behavior of the regolith grains will dictate the asteroid’s surface morphology and its response to impact or spacecraft contact.Previous laboratory experiments on low-velocity impacts into regolith simulant with grain sizes &lt;250 µm have revealed a transition of the grain behavior from a gravity-dominated regime to a cohesion-dominated regime when the local gravity level reaches values below 10<SUP>-3</SUP>g. This is in good agreement with analytical and simulation studies for these grain sizes. From the expected grain sizes at the surfaces of Ryugu and Bennu, we have now focused on larger grain sizes ranging from mm to cm. We have carried out a series of experiments to study the cohesion behavior of such larger grains of asteroid regolith simulant. The simulant used was CI Orgueil of Deep Space Industries. Experiments included laboratory tabletop avalanching, compression and shear force measurements, as well as low-velocity impacts under microgravity.Our goal is to determine if the grain size distribution has an influence on the cohesion behavior of the regolith and if we can validate numerical simulation results with experimental measurements. We will discuss the implications of our results for sample return or landing missions to small bodies such as asteroids or Martian moons.",

These solar occultations complement the set of stellar occultations measured by the broadband UVIS High Speed Photometer in the far ultraviolet (110-190 nm). We provide a uniform calibration of all of the UVIS solar occultation data across the full ring system. We have compiled complete catalogs of these occultations as high-level data products delivered to the Planetary Data System (PDS) Ring Moon Systems Node. This manuscript serves as a guide to this dataset and the corresponding high-level data products outlining their value for analysis of Saturn's rings. These products include light curves and optical depth profiles as functions of ring radius. In addition to providing key parameters of interest obtained through each of these occultations, we show that the optical depths of various ring regions derived from solar occultations are consistent with those from stellar occultations. We also demonstrate that fits to self-gravity wake parameters are similar for solar and stellar occultations. Lastly, we identify a variety of potential spectral trends at various ring locations that future investigations may further explore to address key questions pertaining to the properties of Saturn's rings.",

      "abstract": "Open-source Large Language Models enable projects such as NASA SciX (i.e., NASA ADS) to think out of the box and try alternative approaches for information retrieval and data augmentation, while respecting data copyright and users' privacy. However, when large language models are directly prompted with questions without any context, they are prone to hallucination. At NASA SciX we have developed an experiment where we created semantic vectors for our large collection of abstracts and full-text content, and we designed a prompt system to ask questions using contextual chunks from our system. Based on a non-systematic human evaluation, the experiment shows a lower degree of hallucination and better responses when using Retrieval Augmented Generation. Further exploration is required to design new features and data augmentation processes at NASA SciX that leverages this technology while respecting the high level of trust and quality that the project holds.",

      "abstract": "Observations of the collisional evolution of particle ensembles in a microgravity environment are necessary to characterize the processes that lead to the formation of planetesimals, km-size and larger bodies, within the protoplanetary disk. The two current theories of planetesimal formation, namely growth through binary sticking collisions and gravitational instability within the protoplanetary disk, have difficulties in explaining how particles grow beyond a centimeter in size. In this paper we describe the CubeSat Particle Aggregation and Collision Experiment (Q-PACE), a Low Earth Orbit 3U CubeSat mission that will provide a high-quality, long duration microgravity environment in which we will observe collisions between particles under conditions relevant to planetesimal formation. We have designed a series of experiments involving a broad range of particle size, density, surface properties, and collision velocities to observe collisional outcomes from bouncing to sticking as well as aggregate disruption in tens of thousands of collisions.",

      "title": "Numerical Modeling of Recurring Slope Lineae and Slope Streak Formation through Dry Grainflow Mechanisms on Mars",
      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), seasonally varying low-albedo streaks on steep slopes, remain some of the most poorly understood surface features on Mars. They incrementally lengthen down steep, high-albedo slopes, and emanate from locations where regolith contacts bedrock. Shortly after their discovery, RSL were thought to be the best evidence for liquid water on the surface of Mars. As additional RSL sites were discovered, these sites proved difficult to justify hydrologically. The slopes on which RSL form are at or above the dynamic angle of repose, the angle at which granular material stops flowing. These grainflows have an RSL-like albedo contrast with respect to the surrounding surface and demonstrate that darkening can be explained by removing or overlaying surficial dust. Such sites led to a hypothesis (Dundas, 2020) that RSL are sourced via aeolian sands. Seasonal changes in winds act to transport sand to locations where (1) upslope saltation (grain transport) is impeded by large topographic rises (outcropping bedrock), or (2) downslope saltation is minimized due to wind shadowing of the outcropping bedrock. Aeolian sand then accumulates until slope failure occurs, after which it flows downslope, and produces a dark streak as it displaces dust on the surface. This sand is transported back up the slope by the wind. <P />Slope streaks are similarly low-albedo streak features that occur on steep slopes. They are thought to form in a similar manner to RSL where a dry grainflow displaces brighter surrounding dust revealing a dark streak. However, despite this similarity, SS differ from RSL in that they are much broader (widths of ~200 m vs. 5 m), start and end on much shallower slopes, do not incrementally lengthen, and fade over much longer timescales (~years vs. months). At least six wet based SS formation theories have been proposed. However, extraordinary claims of water have not been supported by extraordinary evidence of water, and therefore we focus on testing the dry grainflow hypothesis. While this dry grainflow mechanism for RSL and SS, only Sullivan et al. (2001) quantitative modeled the physics behind SS formation. We update this model using a better physical model and use more realistic slopes. <P />To numerically constrain the formation mechanisms for RSL and SS on Mars we are conducting a three-pronged investigation involving remote sensing (HiRISE observations to include relevant slope properties as initial conditions for the numerical model and feature characteristics to match to), experimental calibration (angle of repose experiments with regolith simulant), and numerical modeling to assess the feasibility of RSL and SS formation through dry granular flow mechanisms. In the presented work, we focus on the implementation of Discrete Element Method (DEM) coarse-graining simulations using LIGGGHTS, an open-source granular dynamics software, to mimic Martian slope conditions and particle properties yielding numerical constraints on the sand volumes necessary to replicate observed RSL characteristics. We will share updates on our ongoing effort to provide the first numerical constraints on the production of slope features on Mars that progress our understanding of granular flow dynamics on Mars' surface.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), seasonally varying dark streaks on Mars' surface of unknown origin remain some of the most poorly understood features on Mars. These features have been considered the best evidence for liquid water flow on the surface of Mars, but a competing hypothesis for the origin of these enigmatic features does not require water and instead forms them via wind-cached grainflows. This hypothesis suggests that seasonal changes in winds act to cache lofted sand in locations where: (1) upslope saltation (grain transport) is impeded by large topographic rises (outcropping bedrock), or (2) downslope saltation is minimized due to wind shadowing outcropping bedrock. This cache then accumulates until slope failure. The released sand due to slope failure would then produce a dark streak as it displaces dust on the surface thereby producing an RSL without requiring liquid water. Confirming or refuting whether dry grainflows can produce these features has important implications for our understanding of water on Mars. Small aeolian features are below the resolution of available observations, so supporting evidence for this hypothesis requires simulating the conditions that would yield these features and comparing these simulated grainflows to RSL observations. Grainflow simulations can be produced via discrete element method modeling using the open-source software LIGGGHTS. This software is capable of simulating millions of particles with tunable properties (including particle size distribution and material) while under the influence of tunable external forces. We present results from our investigation of the hypothesized dry grainflow mechanism for RSL formation through parametric studies carried out using LIGGGHTS to identify grainflow conditions that would produce observed RSL flow rates and extents measured from HiRISE observations of Rauna crater.",
