      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "A new model of katabatic winds is presented. A hydraulic approach is employed in which the detailed vertical structure of the flow is replaced by a quiescent stably stratified environment and an equivalent flowing layer which is subject to sustained layer cooling, surface stress and interfacial entrainment. A scaling which contains most of the parametric behavior is found. It shows that interfacial entrainment is the dominating retardation mechanism of the flow and that surface stress may be relatively unimportant.Steady solutions are presented to show that katabatic winds are essentially supercritical on all practical slopes (slope angles &gt;0.1°), and are affected by ambient stratification only at large distances. The model is in satisfactory quantitative agreement with the limited field data available.",

      "abstract": "The temporal and spatial development of katabatic winds along an idealized slope representative of Anmtarctic terrain is examined using a hydrostatic, two-dimensional primitive equation model with explicit longwave radiation parameterization. A detailed diagnosis is made of a simulation in which katabatic flow develops from rest due to the strong radiational cooling of the underlying surface. Significant thermodynamic and dynamic differences are seen between the gravity-driven flows over the gently-sloping interior and over the steep ice slopes near the coast. The strongest temperature inversions and largest static stabilities are found over the interior of the continent, although the net cooling of the katabatic layer and magnitude of the downslope-directed horizontal pressure gradient force are greatest at the coast. The interior is characterized by low Rossby number, quasi-geostrophic type flows, while more intense, near-antitriptic winds occur at the coast. Model results are in reasonable agreement with the limited Antarctic observations.",

      "abstract": "Prominent warm signatures of strong, negatively buoyant, katabatic airstreams are present at thermal infrared wavelengths as a result of intense vertical mixing and drift-snow transport within stable boundary layers. These tracers are used to illustrate several aspects of the behavior of katabatic winds in the Ross Sea sector of the Antarctic. The satellite features are compared with surface-based observations whenever possible. Converging surface-wind signatures upslope from Terra Nova Bay are shown to closely follow the observed time-averaged streamlines of drainage airflow. The satellite-observed core of the katabatic airstream descends to sea level via a direct route, but complex three-dimensional trajectories are manifested in marginal regions. Katabatic winds propagating horizontally for hundreds of kilometers over the southwestern Ross Sea do not exhibit the expected influence of the Coriolis force. Katabatic signatures are shown to be climatological features over the Ross Ice Shelf which closely follow surface wind measurements. An approximate proportionality appears to exist between average signature size over the shelf and the magnitude of katabatic mass transport from the plateau.",

      "abstract": "Results of a case study of katabatic winds utilizing tethered balloon profiling equipment are presented and discussed. The data are unique in the detail they provide of both vector wind and potential virtual temperature throughout the flow.It is concluded from the data that the one-dimensional models so far proposed in the literature are inappropriate. Direct computation shows that the divergence of radiation responsible for cooling the air is much smaller than the surface radiation flux used in these models. The inadequacy of these models is not due to the underlying assumption of temporal invariance, but rather the implication is that the flow is significantly three dimensional.Use of surface stress as the retarding stress in the dynamical balance is also shown to be erroneous, at least so long as ambient wind does not assist the katabatic flow. The stress between the flow and the ambient air is much more important and this stress is inextricably tied in with the downslope development of the flow which is thus inferred to play a major part in the dynamics of katabatic winds.Katabatic flow is an example of an internal mixing process. The data are shown to suggest a critical gradient Richardson number of about 1/4 for the maintenance of internal mixing above slope flows.",

      "abstract": "Katabatic winds are a common feature of the lower Antarctic atmosphere. Although these drainage flows are quite shallow, there is increasing evidence that the low-level circulations are an important component in establishing large-scale tropospheric motions in the high southern latitudes. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime and attendant tropospheric circulations have been conducted over the entire continent to depict the topographically forced drainage patterns in the near-surface layer of the atmosphere. Results of the simulation enable a mapping of katabatic wind potential and identification of coastal regions which may experience anomalously intense katabatic winds. A large upper-level cyclonic circulation forms rapidly in response to the evolving katabatic wind structure in the lower atmosphere, suggesting that the drainage circulations are an important component in prescribing the resulting resulting circumpolar vortex. These results imply that some representation of the Antarctic katabatic wind regime is necessary in general circulation models in order to properly simulate the large-scale circulations about the continent.",

      "title": "Katabatic wind forcing of the Terra Nova Bay polynya",
      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The Terra Nova Bay polynya is a perennial winter feature in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica, which occupies roughly 1000 km<SUP>2</SUP>, it is formed and maintained by the combined influence of persistent katabatic winds, which advect newly formed bay ice eastward, and the Drygalski Ice Tongue, which prevents northward drifting pack ice from entering Terra Nova Bay. Existence of anomalously strong katabatic drainage along this coast is predicted by Parish's (1982) simulation of wintertime airflow which reveals a pronounced confluence of surface winds upslope from the Reeves Glacier where the winds are further focused by local topography. The simulation is strongly supported by regional sastrugi orientations. Average wintertime atmospheric conditions and ice sheet topography which control surface air drainage are stable on a climatic time scale; therefore, persistent wintertime katabatic winds should be an annual phenomenon. Further evidence comes from multi-year Landsat images which consistently show windswept, snowfree areas on the Reeves Glacier. In marked contrast to typical Antarctic katabatic winds, strong persistent winter winds are observed at sea level ∼25 km beyond the coastal slope break. Air probably descends as bora-type winds and is likely to be significantly denser than the air at sea level; conditions are not favorable for hydraulic jumps apparently typical of other katabatic regimes. The horizontal density difference is maintained during airflow across the Nansen Ice Sheet because relatively little air mass modification occurs there in contrast to situations where air moves over an ice-laden ocean. Observations thus suggest that katabatic winds maintain their identity for some distance seaward of the coast; qualitative trajectory calculations indicate that for representative geostrophic conditions this distance is on the order of the observed polynya width. Estimated ice freezing rates are ∼20 cm day<SUP>-1</SUP>, but wind-generated waves and currents prevent ice from consolidating. The blocking effect of the Drygalski Ice Tongue is a consequence of its orientation with regard to western Ross Sea ice drift patterns; ice tongue length controls polynya width. Absence of such blocking along other coasts experiencing strong katabatic outflow partly explains why similar polynyas do not form there.",

      "abstract": "The winds observed in Adélie Land, eastern Antarctica, are the strongest observed anywhere on Earth close to sea level, e.g., Cape Denison measured a mean annual wind speed of about 20ms<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some historic data from the area are available; however, such measurements were carried out at different places for different time periods. Hence in December 1992, we placed four automatic weather stations along the coast of Adélie Land, two in the maximum wind jet (Port Martin and Cape Denison) and one on each side of this jet (D 10 close to Dumont d'Urville and Penguin Point, respectively). We obtained about three months of good data, as on March 25, 1993, a strong storm destroyed three of the four wind sensors. Wind velocities are discussed as a function of other meteorological parameters. Further, the interrelationships between the stations are described. Some of the findings are (1) the very high wind speeds reported earlier this century are in agreement with our measurements; the wind directional constancy is high; (2) historic measurements reported Cape Denison to be the windiest station, not only for Antarctica, but also close to sea level for planet Earth; again our measurements are in agreement; (3) very strong wind speeds have a more down-slope direction than weaker ones; (4) the general atmospheric pressure gradient enhanced or inhibited the gravity flow; this is especially well pronounced in summer; and (5) in summer, above normal pressure is correlated with above normal temperatures; in fall the opposite holds true.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The general issue of katabatic wind-driven exchange in fjords is considered using an idealized numerical model, theory, and observations. Two regimes are identified. For fjords narrower than a viscous boundary layer width, the exchange is limited by a balance between wind and friction in lateral boundary layers. For the nonlinear viscous parameterization used here, this boundary layer thickness depends on the properties of the fjord, such as stratification and length, as well as on the wind stress and numerical parameters such as grid spacing and an empirical constant. For wider fjords typical of east Greenland, the balance is primarily between wind, the along-fjord pressure gradient, and acceleration, in general agreement with previous two-layer nonrotating theories. It is expected that O(10%) of the surface layer will be flushed out of the fjord by a single wind event. Application of the idealized model to a typical katabatic wind event produces outflowing velocities that are in general agreement with observations in Sermilik Fjord, a large glacial fjord in southeast Greenland. The presence of a sill has only a minor influence on the exchange until the sill penetrates over most of the lower layer thickness, in which cases the exchange is reduced. It is concluded that the multiple katabatic wind events per winter that are experienced by the fjords along east Greenland represent an important mechanism of exchange between the fjord and shelf, with implications for the renewal of warm, salty waters at depth and for the export of glacial freshwater in the upper layer.",

      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Katabatic winds dramatically affect the climate of the McMurdo dry valleys, Antarctica. Winter wind events can increase local air temperatures by 30°C. The frequency of katabatic winds largely controls winter (June to August) temperatures, increasing 1°C per 1% increase in katabatic frequency, and it overwhelms the effect of topographic elevation (lapse rate). Summer katabatic winds are important, but their influence on summer temperature is less. The spatial distribution of katabatic winds varies significantly. Winter events increase by 14% for every 10 km up valley toward the ice sheet, and summer events increase by 3%. The spatial distribution of katabatic frequency seems to be partly controlled by inversions. The relatively slow propagation speed of a katabatic front compared to its wind speed suggests a highly turbulent flow. The apparent wind skip (down-valley stations can be affected before up-valley ones) may be caused by flow deflection in the complex topography and by flow over inversions, which eventually break down. A strong return flow occurs at down-valley stations prior to onset of the katabatic winds and after they dissipate. Although the onset and termination of the katabatic winds are typically abrupt, elevated air temperatures remain for days afterward. We estimate that current frequencies of katabatic winds increase annual average temperatures by 0.7° to 2.2°C, depending on location. Seasonally, they increase (decrease) winter average temperatures (relative humidity) by 0.8° to 4.2° (-1.8 to -8.5%) and summer temperatures by 0.1° to 0.4°C (-0.9% to -4.1%). Long-term changes of dry valley air temperatures cannot be understood without knowledge of changes in katabatic winds.",

Katabatic wind is strongest in the morning when the surface temperature gradient between ocean and land reaches a maximum. The sea surface wind simulated by the MM5 model and that derived from the calibrated SAR normalized radar cross section are in good agreement.

Over the continental margins, persistent katabatic winds blow all year long and supply the lower troposphere with unsaturated air. We show that this dry air leads to significant low-level sublimation of snowfall. We found using unprecedented data collected over 1 year on the coast of Adélie Land and simulations from different atmospheric models that low-level sublimation accounts for a 17% reduction of total snowfall over the continent and up to 35% on the margins of East Antarctica, significantly affecting satellite-based estimations close to the ground. Our findings suggest that, as climate warming progresses, this process will be enhanced and will limit expected precipitation increases at the ground level.",

During the summer of 2007, observations were made of katabatic flows at the northern edge of Hofsjökull ( FLOHOF - FLow Over and around HOFsjökull). The observations reveal that katabatic winds are quite persistent at the edge of the glacier. However, they extend only a short distance away from the glacier, and at a distance of 7 km from the edge, the katabatic winds are almost non-existent. There is a strong diurnal cycle in the katabatic winds, with a maximum in strength and frequency in the afternoon and a minimum in the early morning. The onset of the katabatic winds is associated with a drop in temperature.",
