      "abstract": "Stellar aberration is explained by the relative motion between a star and an observer on Earth. Based on the principle of invariance, Einstein's relativity predicts that absolute motion does not exist. Consequently, there should be no difference between a star having a velocity with respect to an observer and an observer having a velocity with respect to a star. In the case of stellar aberration this prediction appears contrary to observation. It is shown that the description of stellar aberration, in terms of relative transverse velocity between the star and an observer on Earth, should be corrected, because it is an erroneous interpretation of Einstein's relativity.",

      "abstract": "The tangent bundle of spacetime consists of spacetime in the base manifold and four-velocity space in the fiber [1]. The coordinates of a point in the spacetime tangent bundle are the spacetime and four-velocity coordinates of the observer. Einsteinian relativity plays a central role in the formulation of possible differential geometric structures and embedded fields in the spacetime tangent bundle. The covariant four-acceleration of Einstein's theory of general relativity plays a particularly important role. The quantum mechanics of the vacuum suggests the existence of a limiting proper acceleration, thereby placing restrictions on the differential geometric structure of the spacetime tangent bundle, and also on the structure of embedded classical and quantum fields [2-4]. In the present work, examples are addressed emphasizing the roles of both special-relativistic Lorentz invariance and general relativistic covariance in the theory of the spacetime tangent bundle.

      "abstract": "Einstein's relativity theory demands that all meaningful physical objects should be defined covariantly, i.e. in a coordinate independent way. Concepts of relative velocity, acceleration, gravity acceleration and gravity potential are fundamental in Newton's theory and they are imprinted in everyone's physical intuition. Unfortunately, relativistic definitions of them are not commonly known or appreciated. Every now and then some confused authors use wrong, non-covariant, definitions of velocity, acceleration and gravity, based on their vague Newtonian intuitions and hidden in a superficial, often purely semantic, relativistic disguise. A recent example of such a confusion (Gorkavyi &amp; Vasilkov, 2016) is discussed at the end of this Note.",

The most complete way of introducing the modifications is via the noncocommutative Hopf-algebraic structure describing quantum symmetries. Two types of quantum relativistic symmetries are described, one with constant commutator of quantum Minkowski space coordinates (θ<SUB>μν</SUB>-deformation) and second with Lie-algebraic structure of quantum space-time, introducing so-called κ-deformation. The third fundamental constant of Nature — fundamental mass κ or length λ — appears naturally in proposed quantum relativistic symmetry scheme. The deformed Minkowski space is described as the representation space (Hopf-module) of deformed Poincaré algebra. Some possible perspectives of quantum-deformed relativistic symmetries will be outlined.",

We then discuss some of the elementary features of the description of two-particle systems in order to be able to interpret the objects considered. In particular, we show that the description of the free particles conforms to standard relativistic kinematics.

      "abstract": "One of the most difficult questions in present-day physics concerns a fundamental theory of space, time, and matter that incorporates a consistent quantum description of gravity. There are various theoretical approaches to such a quantum-gravity theory. Nevertheless, experimental progress is hampered in this research field because many models predict deviations from established physics that are suppressed by some power of the Planck scale, which currently appears to be immeasurably small. However, tests of relativity theory provide one promising avenue to overcome this phenomeno-logical obstacle: many models for underlying physics can accommodate a small breakdown of Lorentz symmetry, and numerous feasible Lorentz-symmetry tests have Planck reach. Such mild violations of Einstein's relativity have therefore become the focus of recent research efforts. This mini course provides a brief survey of the key ideas in this research field and is geared at both experimentalists and theorists. In particular, several theoretical mechanisms leading to deviations from relativity theory are presented; the standard theoretical framework for relativity violations at currently accessible energy scales (i.e., the SME) is reviewed, and various present and near-future experimental efforts within this field are discussed.",

David Mermin asserts that relativity ought to be an important part of everyone's education--after all, it is largely about time, a subject with which all are familiar. The book reveals that some of our most intuitive notions about time are shockingly wrong, and that the real nature of time discovered by Einstein can be rigorously explained without advanced mathematics. This readable exposition of the nature of time as addressed in Einstein's theory of relativity is accessible to anyone who remembers a little high school algebra and elementary plane geometry. The book evolved as Mermin taught the subject to diverse groups of undergraduates at Cornell University, none of them science majors, over three and a half decades. Mermin's approach is imaginative, yet accurate and complete. Clear, lively, and informal, the book will appeal to intellectually curious readers of all kinds, including even professional physicists, who will be intrigued by its highly original approach.",

It was an open-ended program that developed throughout Einstein's scientific career, giving rise to special relativity, general relativity and unified field theory. In this paper, we want to uncover the methodological logic of the Einsteinian program, which animated the whole program and its development, and as it was revealed in SR, GR, and unified field theory. We aver that the same methodological logic animated all these theories as Einstein's work progressed. Each of these theories contributed towards constructing Einstein's ambitious program. This paper is not a paper in the history of Relativity, but, rather, it utilizes our knowledge of this history to uncover the methodological logic of the relativity program and its development. This logic is latent in the historical narrative, but is not identical to it. We hope to show that the Einsteinian relativity project is still relevant today as a theoretical scheme, despite its failures and despite quantum mechanics.",

      "abstract": "\"The main aim of this textbook is to provide students with a sound mathematical introduction coupled to an understanding of the physical insights needed to explore the subject. Indeed, the book follows Einstein in that it introduces the theory very much from a physical point of view. After introducing the special theory of relativity, the basic field equations of gravitation are derived and discussed carefully as a prelude to first solving them in simple cases and then exploring the three main areas of application. This new edition contains a substantial extension content that considers new and updated developments in the field. Topics include coverage of the advancement of observational cosmology, the detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes and neutron stars, and advancements in modern cosmology. Einstein's theory of relativity is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of the human mind. Yet, in this book, the author makes it possible for students with a wide range of abilities to deal confidently with the subject. Based on both authors' experience teaching the subject this is achieved by breaking down the main arguments into a series of simple logical steps. Full details are provided in the text and the numerous exercises while additional insight is provided through the numerous diagrams. As a result this book makes an excellent course for any reader coming to the subject for the first time while providing a thorough understanding for any student wanting to go on to study the subject in depth\"",

In the earlier papers the author worked exclusively in a specific set of coordinate systems, the harmonic coordinate systems. In this paper the author shows that the procedure developed in the earlier papers can be used without imposing any conditions on the coordinates except that the fundamental field be the Minkowski metric in the absence of particles.

      "authors": [
        "Feria, Erlan"
      ],
      "abstract": "Propelled by the discovery in the late 1990s of the accelerated expansion of the universe, an unknow energy, named dark energy was hypothesized to be responsible. Due to the lack of astronomical observational data, the source of this dark energy remained a mystery until February of this year when a team of astronomers from nine countries provided strong observational evidence that the dark energy exists within isolated supermassive black holes that continue to grow. In this abstract a \"relativity theory of retention (RTR)\" in physics, first published fifteen years ago in a 2008 SPIE article, will be reviewed whose formulation inherently presented the appearance of dark energy in black holes. This theory is anchored in the medium duality formed by a vacuum and a black hole which are extreme medium cases for the motion and retention, respectively, of mass-energy (E=Mc<SUP>2</SUP>). While the energy-mass' speed (defined as the ratio of space-length achieved per the amount-of-time used for the motion of mass-energy) attains a maximum speed in a vacuum given by the speed of light-energy in a vacuum with symbol c of 2.9979 x 10<SUP>8</SUP> m/sec (advancing a upper limit for speeds that sparked the birth of Einstein's relativity theory of motion (RTM) in 1905), the mass-energy's pace (defined as the ratio of linger-length achieved per amount-of-volume used for the retention of mass-energy), attains a maximum pace in a black hole given by the \"pace of dark-energy in a black hole\" with symbol χ (advancing an upper limit for paces that sparked the birth of RTR in 2008). In the 2008 SPIE article using the Bekenstein Hawking entropy for black holes the expression χ=960π c<SUP>2</SUP>/hG for χ was derived where G is the gravitational constant, h is the Planck constant, and 6.1296 x 10<SUP>63</SUP> sec/m<SUP>3</SUP> is the χ value found. While in the RTM its light time-clock (LTC) would convey a time increase or passing of time fueled by a free light-energy (vacuum-energy) that is sourced by the always increasing universe's entropy, in the RTR its dark volume-clock (DVC) would convey a volume increase or passing of volume that is fueled by a bound dark-energy (black-hole-energy) naturally arising from the RTM vacuum-energy. Thus, the discovered volume increase of isolated black holes leading to the universe's accelerated growth is theoretically supported by the RTR's DVC steady tick. In ending, it is highlighted here that the revelation of the RTR naturally emerged from a past-uncertainty/future-certainty time-complementary duality principle of physics (POP), discovered in the late 1970s to have popped up in the 1960 stochastic optimum control work of Rudolph Kalman, discoverer of the Kalman Filter.",

The approximation procedure allows one to find, to any order of approximation desired, the equations of motion satisfied by each particle, the equations of change satisfied by those quantities which characterize the structure of each particle, and the field equations satisfied by the external field which acts on each particle.

      "abstract": "In this paper we unify Theories of Physics (TPs) with real or infinite Universal Speed (c<SUB>I</SUB>), such as Einstein Relativity Theory (ERT) and Newtonian Physics (NPs). Generalized Special Relativity (SR) relates the frames of Relativistic Inertial observers (RIOs) where the spacetime has the metric g<SUB>I</SUB>=diag(g<SUB>I00</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>). The parameter ξ<SUB>I</SUB>=sqrt(-g<SUB>I11</SUB>/g<SUB>I00</SUB>) is contained in the matrix (Λ<SUB>I</SUB>) of the Euclidean Closed Linear Transformation of complex spacetime (ECLSTT). Besides the elements of Λ<SUB>I</SUB> are complex numbers. So, the corresponding spacetime is necessarily complex and there exists real c<SUB>I</SUB>=c/ξ<SUB>I</SUB>. In addition, the complex Cartesian Coordinates (CCs) of the theory, may be turned to the corresponding real CCs, in order to be perceived by human senses. The new real transformation is not closed (the corresponding real matrices Λ<SUB>IR</SUB> do not form a group) and the successive real transformations produce Generalized Thomas Rotation. The specific value ξ<SUB>I</SUB>=1 gives Vossos transformation (VT) endowed with Lorentz metric (for g<SUB>I11</SUB>=1) of complex spacetime and invariant speed of light in vacuum (c<SUB>I</SUB>=c), which produce the Lorentzian version of Euclidean Complex Relativistic Mechanics (ECRMs). The corresponding real matrix (Λ<SUB>IR</SUB>) is the matrix of Lorentz Boost (Λ<SUB>IR</SUB>=Λ<SUB>L</SUB>). The specific value ξ<SUB>I</SUB>→0 gives Galilean Transformation (GT) with invariant time, in which any other ECLSTT is reduced, if one RIO has small velocity wrt another RIO. Thus we unify TPs such as NPs and ERT, keeping the formalism of ERT. The generalized definition of Proper Time (r) gives us the possibility to compute four-velocity, four-momentum, Relativistic Doppler Shift etc, building the whole structure of the Generalized SR and General Relativity (GR). For instance the Generalized Relativistic Energy of Rest Mass (m) is E <SUB>rest</SUB>=mc<SUP>2</SUP>/ξ <SUB>I</SUB> <SUP>2</SUP>. In case of NPs, the annihilation energy becomes infinite. Thus the Lomonosov-Lavoisier Law becomes clear theorem of NPs. In addition, the case of observers with variable metric of spacetime leads to GR. Thus we produce the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Generalized Schwarzschild metric (1GSM) and 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Generalized Schwarzschild metric (2GSM), which are in accordance with Einstein field equations for any TPs. In case of 1GSM, we compute the corresponding Lagrangian, geodesics, equations of motion, precession of planets' orbits etc, resulting formulas which are referred to any TPs. We then combine the theoretical results to the experimental data of our Solar system, producing a set of valid values of ξ <SUB>I</SUB>. In case of 2GSM, the combination of its Galilean version with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), leads to MOND relativization. After, we pass to RIOs with ordinary flat spacetime (Minkowski space), extending MOND methods to ERT. We use Simple and Standard Interpolating Function (μ) to the Lorentzian-Einsteinian version of 2GSM for the explanation of Rotation Curves in Galaxies as well as the Solar system, eliminating Dark Matter. Generally, this approach, in non rotating black hole, planetary and star system scale, coincides to the original Schwarzschild metric, while in galactic scale, it gives MONDian results. In universal scale, the gravitational field strength becomes negative, producing slight antigravity.",

We find that there are simple ideal particles which, in a finite region of space-time, interact with each other, to a good approximation, according to the laws of Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. In a higher order of approximation we find an additional interaction among the particles which can be looked upon as a Lorentz-covariant generalization of the interaction given by Newton's gravitational theory.",

We deduce then a longitudinal component of the tangent vector to Poincare's ellipse which is directly connected to the relativity of simultaneity. We suggest finally that this violation of relativity of simultaneity is related to Einstein's implicit choice of the (non relativistic) transverse gauge in his theory of (rigid) wavefronts.",

These charts are related to each other by the transformations of the inhomogeneous orthochronous Lorentz group. In this article we discuss the possible description of space-time in relativity by charts associating to each event four numbers ( q<SUP>1</SUP>, q<SUP>2</SUP>, q<SUP>3</SUP>, q<SUP>4</SUP>) ≡ ( q, τ) in such a way that these charts are related to each other by transformations of the inhomogeneous Galilei group. Then τ refers to a universal time and q refers to a position in a three-dimensional space supplied with the geometry of the Euclidean group. It is shown that such a description is obtained by measuring time according to the clocks of a privileged frame and by defining the unit length in an appropriate way. The above discussion is mainly motivated by considerations concerning quantum mechanics. Actually, universal time τ permits a consistent quantization in relativity. Afterwards we formulate a model for the quantum relativistic spinless particle of mass m<SUB>0</SUB> based on the assumption that the evolution is governed by the universal time τ. Except for the choice of the Hamiltonian, this model is formulated analogously to the corresponding one in the nonrelativistic case, in particular there exists a position observable. Further we compare the above model with the usual relativistic formalisms. For the free particle case our model may be formulated such as to contain Wigner's group theoretical approach to relativistic quantum mechanics. Further the case of the particle interacting with an external electromagnetic field is discussed in detail and the model is finally compared with the usual Klein-Gordon formalism.",

Thus, we obtain results, which contain the fundamental parameter ξ<SUB>I</SUB>= sqrt(-g<SUB>I11</SUB>/g<SUB>I00</SUB>) of TPs, where g<SUB>I</SUB>=diag(g<SUB>I00</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>, g<SUB>I11</SUB>) is the spacetime metric of the Relativistic Inertial Observers (RIOs). We then pass to General Relativity, defining the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Generalized Schwarzschild metric (1GSM), in accordance with Einstein field equations for any TPs. We compute the corresponding Lagrangian, equations of motion, precession of planets' orbits etc. The experimental data of our Solar system, produce a valid value of ξ<SUB>I</SUB>. Besides the unification of TPs give us the capability of modifying objects of one TPs (such as NPs with ξ<SUB>I</SUB>=0) in order to be used in another TPs (such as ERT with ξ<SUB>I</SUB>=1). Thus the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Generalized Schwarzschild Metric (2GSM) allows us to transform the metric-gravitation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) to the corresponding of ERT. This explains the rotation curves in galaxies and solar systems, eliminating Dark Matter. Finally we pass to Microcosmos, combining GRB with Quantum-Mechanics. Thus we obtain valid value of ξ<SUB>I</SUB> on Earth, by using the energies of fine structure peaks of the atomic hydrogen spectrum.",

In these earlier papers two specific procedures were suggested for investigating a particular form of partial differential equation which appears when carrying out the approximation method. One of these two specific procedures was Lorentz-covariant at each stage of the analysis and one was not. In both cases the final result was Lorentz-covariant. In the earlier papers, when applying the approximation method to specific particles, only the noncovariant procedure was used. In this paper we illustrate the use of the Lorentz-covariant procedure by applying this procedure up to fourth order to the case of interacting simple neutral particles-particles which interact only through the gravitational field.",

      "abstract": "Einstein's general relativity postulates that, at each positon within a gravitational field, we must measure the same frequency f 0, but seen from a distance, the frequency at the position of another gravitational potential is different from f 0. As gravity decreases with the increase in the distance from Earth, in the Pound-Rebka experiment at the top of the tower, the frequency of electromagnetic radiation must be higher than at the bottom. If electromagnetic radiation was able to have the same frequency f 0 at the top of the tower as at the bottom of the tower, an observer at the top of the tower would have to be able to increase gravity to the same level that gravity has at the bottom. But the decrease in gravity with an increase in the altitude cannot be reversed. It is demonstrated that the relativistic interpretation of the Pound-Rekba experiment showing a doubling of the gravitational frequency shift for \"two-way\" observations violates the principle of energy conservation, whereas the classical interpretation of the experiment identifies the doubling of the gravitational frequency shift as a pure mathematical effect that has no physical reality, which always occurs when we subtract relative differences with opposite algebraic signs from each other. It is shown that Einstein's general relativity only seemingly corresponds with reality; thus, gravitational frequency (time) shifts must be interpreted according to classical considerations.",

      "abstract": "Considering that an Einstein clock can travel at a speed no greater than c, from the principle of relativity, a kinematic time dilation factor can be derived whose value cannot be greater than 2 . In fact, however, the kinematic time dilation factor γ can approach an infinite value. This discrepancy demonstrates that the derivation of the kinematic time dilation factor γ in Einstein's special relativity (SR) cannot be physically justified by the principle of relativity, and that it is not physically possible that the speed of light is constant in any frame of reference. The mathematical method of Einstein's SR, which I refer to as the \"mathematical method of relativity,\" allows the calculation of constant physical values from different quantities of any physical unit and is thus scientifically worthless. Accordingly, it is not surprising that it is possible to predict so-called general relativistic phenomena, e.g., the phenomena observed at the binary pulsar PSR B1913 + 16, just by applying Kepler's second law and simple quantum physical considerations [R. G. Ziefle, Phys. Essays 33, 99 (2020)]. A careful interpretation of interferometer experiments on Earth clearly shows that there is in fact no need for artificial time acceleration by length contraction. However, today's physicists seem to be lost in mathematics. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a physical theory of relativity that does not require mathematical tricks, such as time acceleration (length contraction), space-time curvature, and other mathematical tricks that follow from Einstein's mathematical methods and uphold the illusion that the belief in a constant speed of light c in any frame of reference is physically justified.",

Chamseddine and Mukhanov in the arXiv preprint 1308.5410 have separated the conformal mode of a physical metric in the form of a squared gradient of an auxiliary scalar field. Notably, the variational principle has given a more general equation of motion than that of purely Einsteinian relativity theory, with a possibility of reproducing an effective Dark Matter. In this short Letter, we explain the nature of this phenomenon in terms of the class of functions on which the variation takes place. Then we give a more transparent equivalent formulation of the model without an auxiliary metric. Finally, we speculate a bit about possible extensions.",

Equivalence of the Palatini and metric formulations at the level of equations of motion, which as we will argue is a manifestation of the casuality based on Einstein relativity, is a physical criterion that restricts form of Lagrangians of modified gravity theories. We prove that within the class of modified gravity theories we consider, only the Lovelock gravity satisfies this requirement.",

      "abstract": "Einstein learned from the magnet and conductor thought experiment how to use field transformation laws to extend the covariance of Maxwells electrodynamics. If he persisted in his use of this device, he would have found that the theory cleaves into two Galilean covariant parts, each with different field transformation laws. The tension between the two parts reflects a failure not mentioned by Einstein: that the relativity of motion manifested by observables in the magnet and conductor thought experiment does not extend to all observables in electrodynamics. An examination of Ritz's work shows that Einstein's early view could not have coincided with Ritz's on an emission theory of light, but only with that of a conveniently reconstructed Ritz. One Ritz-like emission theory, attributed by Pauli to Ritz, proves to be a natural extension of the Galilean covariant part of Maxwell's theory that happens also to accommodate the magnet and conductor thought experiment. Einstein's famous chasing a light beam thought experiment fails as an objection to an ether-based, electrodynamical theory of light. However it would allow Einstein to formulate his general objections to all emission theories of light in a very sharp form. Einstein found two well known experimental results of 18th and 19th century optics compelling (Fizeau's experiment, stellar aberration), while the accomplished Michelson-Morley experiment played no memorable role. I suggest they owe their importance to their providing a direct experimental grounding for Lorentz' local time, the precursor of Einstein's relativity of simultaneity, and doing it essentially independently of electrodynamical theory. I attribute Einstein's success to his determination to implement a principle of relativity in electrodynamics, but I urge that we not invest this stubbornness with any mystical prescience.",

      "abstract": "We present some philosophical and physical arguments supporting the hypothesis that the most fundamental self-interacting field in an amorphous space-time is the field of linear frames, i.e. the quadruple of vector bosons. We construct a wide class of Lagrangian dynamical models invariant under the total group of diffeomorphisms and under the natural action of the proper linear group GL <SUP>+</SUP> (4, R) on the tetrad field. There exist some links between these models and the Hamiltonian dynamical systems on GL <SUP>+</SUP> (3, R) (the mechanics of affinely-rigid bodies [23] [27]). We present the general form of field equations, conservation laws and Bianchi identities. There exist some formal similarities between our Lagrangians and those used in non-linear electrodynamics, in particular in the Born-Infeld theory [21]. We also give a few rough remarks concerning models invariant under natural subgroups of GL <SUP>+</SUP> (4, R), i.e. under SL(4, R) and SO(1, 3; R) (special linear group and Lorentz group). The latter class includes the conventional Einstein relativity and the more general metrical-parallelism models. It turns out that there are GL <SUP>+</SUP> (4, R)-invariant Lagrangians which are structurally alike the conventional Einstein Lagrangian. We have not derived as yet either mathematical or physical consequences of the presented model. Nevertheless, it seems to follow from our discussion that, a priori, the GL <SUP>+</SUP> (4, R)-invariant tetrad models could be competitive with the Einstein theory. The next thing to be done would be a careful mathematical analysis of these models and attempts to compare their consequences with those of the Einstein relativity and of other field theories.",

Since the spacetime is asymptotically a cylindrical anti-de Sitter spacetime, we will be able to calculate the mass, momentum and electric charge of the solutions. We find two families of solutions, one with longitudinal magnetic field and the other with angular magnetic field. The source for the longitudinal magnetic field can be interpreted as composed of a system of two symmetric and superposed electrically charged lines with one of the electrically charged lines being at rest and the other spinning. The angular magnetic field solution can be similarly interpreted as composed of charged lines but now one is at rest and the other has a velocity along the axis. This solution cannot be extended down to the origin.",

Unsatisfied with Lorentz's electron theory, he proposed an alternative electrodynamics of moving bodies based on a modification of Maxwell's macroscopic field equations that managed to account for all relevant electrodynamic and optical experiments, including that of Michelson and Morley. Some of his insights foreshadow aspects of Einstein's relativity theory, especially the elimination of the ether and the criticism of Lorentz's implicit distinction between true and measured coordinates of space and time. However, Cohn did not believe in the general validity of the relativity principle, and did not require a revision of the usual concepts of space and time.",

      "abstract": "The experimental testing of the Lorentz transformations is based on a family of sets of coordinate transformations that do not comply in general with the principle of equivalence of the inertial frames. The Lorentz and Galilean sets of transformations are the only member sets of the family that satisfy this principle. In the neighborhood of regular points of space-time, all members in the family are assumed to comply with local homogeneity of space-time and isotropy of space in at least one free-falling elevator, to be denoted as Robertson'sab initio rest frame [H. P. Robertson,Rev. Mod. Phys.21, 378 (1949)]. Without any further assumptions, it is shown that Robertson's rest frame becomes a preferred frame for all member sets of the Robertson family except for, again, Galilean and Einstein's relativities. If one now assumes the validity of Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics in the preferred frame, a different electrodynamics spontaneously emerges for each set of transformations. The flat space-time of relativity retains its relevance, which permits an obvious generalization, in a Robertson context, of Dirac's theory of the electron and Einstein's gravitation. The family of theories thus obtained constitutes a covering theory of relativistic physics. A technique is developed to move back and forth between Einstein's relativity and the different members of the family of theories. It permits great simplifications in the analysis of relativistic experiments with relevant \"Robertson's subfamilies.\" It is shown how to adapt the Clifford algebra version of standard physics for use with the covering theory and, in particular, with the covering Dirac theory.",

Two independent numerical codes are developed, and solution sequences that model inspiraling binary neutron stars during the final several orbits are successfully computed. The binding energy of the system near its final orbit deviates from earlier results of third post-Newtonian and of spatially conformally flat calculations.

      "abstract": "Prior to the 1600s c.e., the church was the final authority for theories about the universe and humanity's role within it. However, when the mathematical theories put forth by scientists such as Copernicus and Galileo refuted traditional theological explanations about the cosmos, a shift to science as the premiere authority for theories was established, a tradition which continues to this day. In the following century, the work of Newton set forth a theory of the universe operating as a machine, where all things were potentially knowable, measurable, and predictable. His mechanistic hypotheses helped substantiate a corollary philosophy known as modernism. In the early 1900s, Einstein's theories about light and relativity began to indicate a universe significantly less absolute. His work set the stage for the development of quantum physics theories, whose hallmarks are probability, uncertainty, and complementarity. Quantum physics theories helped substantiate the philosophy known as postmodernism, where truth is nonexistent, reality is a subjectively constructed phenomenon, and the concept of an individual self is considered an illusion. Given that developments in physics have had profound impact across academic disciplines, including psychology, this study examine the effect of major revolutions in physics to corollary developments in theories about the self in psychology. It is the assertion of this work that modernist conceptualization of the self is one that is highly individualistic and defined in mechanistic terms, whereas the postmodern conceptualization of the self is significantly more socially constructed and has more interpersonally fluid, amorphous boundaries. Implications for conceptualizations of the self from either the modern or postmodern paradigm are discussed, as well as suggestions for future theory development.",

In the 1905 relativity paper Einstein used a seemingly conventional notion, \"light complex\", and he did not invoke his novel quanta of light heuristic with respect to the principle of relativity. He chose the language \"light complex\" for which no clear definition could be given. But with hindsight, in 1905 Einstein made exactly the right choice not to mix concepts from his quantum paper with those from his relativity paper. He focused on the solution of his relativity problem, whose far-reaching perspectives Planck already sensed.",

      "abstract": "Einstein defined time as the length of the light path divided by the speed of light. According to this definition, time can only change if either the length of the light path or the speed of light changes. Einstein replaced this objective mathematical truth with his idea that not only is the speed of light constant but also the length of the light path, so Einstein was able to define a constant proper time t 0 in all frames of reference. However, treating distances as constant contradicts the physical definition of motion. Therefore, Einstein's relativity not only violates mathematical and physical rules but also violates logical rules when it claims that the reason why clocks measure different times is that all clocks measure the same time t 0. Einstein's physical half-truth, which makes a false statement about the lengths of light paths, which cannot be constant, leads to contradictions with reality, which Einstein compensated for by mathematical corrections. This inevitably led to a mathematical pseudoreality that is described by theoretical physics according to Einstein's idea. However, Einstein's principle of relativity cannot be mathematically manipulated. If we compare at least three reference frames, we obtain contradictory results for the kinematic and gravitational time dilation. In this case, e.g., the paradox arises that an atomic clock must be able to count forward and backward at the same time. Comparing only two frames of reference, the proper time t 0 can be arbitrarily assigned to each of the two frames of reference without contradictions occurring. However, if an experimental setup is always chosen in such a way that at most two frames of reference are compared, and so Einstein's relativity cannot be falsified, a systematic error is applied, and the experiment is scientifically worthless as far as the confirmation of Einstein's relativistic SR and GR is concerned.",

However, the effect of quantum gravity could bring an energy dependence of light speed, and a series of studies on high-energy photon events from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) suggest a light speed variation $v(E)=c\\left(1-E/{E}_{\\mathrm{LV}}\\right)$ with E <SUB>LV</SUB> = 3.6 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> GeV or a bound E <SUB>LV</SUB> ≥ 3.6 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> GeV. From the newly observed gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, we find that a 99.3 GeV photon detected by Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) is coincident with the sharp spike in the light curves detected by both Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and HEBS under the above scenario of light speed variation, suggesting an option that this high-energy photon was emitted at the same time as a sharp spike of low-energy photon emission at the GRB source. Thus this highest energy photon event detected by Fermi-LAT during the prompt emission of GRBs might be considered as an optional signal for the linear form modification of light speed in cosmological space.",

The technology has evolved from atomic discharge lamps and interferometry, to narrow atomic resonances in laser-cooled atoms that are probed by frequency-stabilized cw lasers that in turn control optical frequency synthesizers (combs) based on ultra-fast mode-locked lasers. Recent technological advances have improved the performance of optical frequency references by almost four orders of magnitude in the last eight years. This has stimulated new enthusiasm for the development of optical atomic clocks, and allows new probes into nature, such as searches for time variation of fundamental constants and precision spectroscopy.",

The null result of this experiment gave rise to Fresnel's hypothesis of an ether partly dragged by a moving substance. In the context of Einstein's relativity, the sole frame which is privileged in Arago's experiment is the proper frame of the prism, and the null result only says that Snell's law is valid in that frame. We revisit the history of this premature first evidence against the ether theory and calculate Fresnel's dragging coefficient by applying Huygens' construction in the frame of the prism. We expose the dissimilar treatment received by the ray and the wavefront as an unavoidable consequence of the classical notions of space and time.",

The combination of these two factors gave rise to a natural desire, at least at the phenomenological level, to build a cosmological model that represents the synthesis of gravity and thermodynamics and does not include components of an unknown nature. It is this modelùentropic cosmologyùthat is considered in this review. We have set as our goal, omitting the details that can be found in the references given, to present the conceptual foundations of the model.",

We discuss how the Poincaré-Snyder relativity may provide a stronger framework for the description of the usual (Einstein) relativistic quantum mechanics and present a first look of the interesting picture from the new perspective.",

Bohm suggested, by immediate momentum and energy transfer with the magnet, rather than by subsequent, which-way determination at the screen. The same two beam spots at the detector screen will result. Einsteinian relativity, and the understanding of Schrödinger evolution applicability through a static potential, forbid continuation of a spin superposition through the Stern–Gerlach field. A calculation for single wavepacket development there conforms to observations from the Stern–Gerlach experiment. And several experiments corroborate immediate reduction to a single spin eigenfunction in the magnetic field. Additionally, Ramsey's separated, oscillating fields observations, and related experiments, do not rebut this understanding.",

The behavior, in the distant past, of the orbit of two particles weakly interacting gravitationally, with radiation reaction taken into account, is then used to compute the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding curvature tensor along past-directed null straight lines in the flat background. It is found, on the one hand, that the falloff of the curvature is fast enough to guarantee satisfaction of a condition to exclude incoming gravitational radiation. On the other hand, the falloff is slower than would have been expected if the conformally rescaled curvature tensor had been regular on the hypersurface at past null infinity of the flat background.",

In this paper we discuss the rules of these transformations for geometric quantities as well as for the matter energy-momentum tensor. We show the subtlety of the matter energy-momentum conservation law which refers to the fact that the conformal transformation \"creates\" an extra matter term composed of the conformal factor which enters the conservation law. In an extreme case of the flat original spacetime the matter is \"created\" due to work done by the conformal transformation to bend the spacetime which was originally flat. We discuss how to construct the conformally invariant gravity theories and also find the conformal transformation rules for the curvature invariants $R^2$, $R_{ab}R^{ab}$, $R_{abcd}R^{abcd}$ and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant in a spacetime of an arbitrary dimension. Finally, we present the conformal transformation rules in the fashion of the duality transformations of the superstring theory. In such a case the transitions between conformal frames reduce to a simple change of the sign of a redefined conformal factor.",

A chapter is devoted to applications of point form quantum mechanics to nuclear physics.",

Mathematical models of natural phenomena can be manually created from domain knowledge and fitted to data, or, in contrast, created automatically from large datasets with machine-learning algorithms. The problem of incorporating prior knowledge expressed as constraints on the functional form of a learned model has been studied before, while finding models that are consistent with prior knowledge expressed via general logical axioms is an open problem. We develop a method to enable principled derivations of models of natural phenomena from axiomatic knowledge and experimental data by combining logical reasoning with symbolic regression. We demonstrate these concepts for Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption. We show we can discover governing laws from few data points when logical reasoning is used to distinguish between candidate formulae having similar error on the data.",

A new and natural time scale is defined on a physical basis using group-theoretical arguments. An additive notion of time is obtained according to which the age of the universe is indeed infinite. In other words, never did the Big Bang begin. This new time scale is not supposed to replace the ordinary cosmic time scale, but to supplement it (in the same way as rapidity has taken a place by the side of velocity in Einsteinian relativity). The question is discussed within the framework of conventional (big-bang) and classical (nonquantum) cosmology, but could easily be extended to more elaborate views, as the purpose is not so much to modify present theories as to reach a deeper understanding of their meaning.",

This computation is important for scalar-tensor theories that are expressed in the Einstein frame, such as chameleon and symmetron theories, which can incorporate hiding mechanisms that predict environment-dependent PPN parameters. We introduce a general formalism for scalar-tensor theories and constrain it using the limit on γ given by the Cassini experiment. In particular, we discuss massive Brans-Dicke scalar fields for extended sources. Next, using a recently proposed Earth satellite experiment, in which atomic clocks are used for spacecraft tracking, we compute the observable perturbations in the redshift induced by PPN parameters deviating from their general relativistic values. Our estimates suggest that |γ -1 |∼|β -1 |∼10<SUP>-6</SUP> may be detectable by a satellite that carries a clock with fractional frequency uncertainty Δ f /f ∼10<SUP>-16</SUP> in an eccentric orbit around the Earth. Such space experiments are within reach of existing atomic clock technology. We discuss further the requirements necessary for such a mission to detect deviations from Einstein relativity.",

The concept of magnetic monopoles has at least two attractive features: (i) Electric and magnetic fields can be described equivalently. (ii) In contrast to quantum electrodynamics, models of monopoles are able to explain the quantization of electric charge. We suggest a quantum field theoretical model of the electromagnetic interaction that describes electricity and magnetism as equivalent as possible. This model requires the cross-section of Salam's \"magnetic photon\" to depend on the absolute motion of the electric charge with which it interacts. We suggest a tabletop experiment to verify this magnetic photon. Its discovery by the predicted effect would have far-reaching consequences: (i) Evidence for a new gauge boson and a new kind of radiation which may find applications in medicine. (ii) Evidence for symmetrized Maxwell equations. (iii) Evidence for an absolute rest frame that gives rise to local physical effects and violation of Einstein's relativity principle.",

The first seven chapters describe how light behaves, develop Newton's particle theory, introduce waves and an electromagnetic wave theory of light, discover the photon, and culminate in the wave-particle duality. The book then goes on to develop the special theory of relativity, showing how time dilation and length contraction are consequences of the two simple principles on which the theory is founded. An extensive chapter derives the equation E = mc<SUP>2</SUP> clearly from first principles and then explores its consequences and the misconceptions surrounding it. That most famous of issues arising from special relativity - the aging of the twins - is treated simply but compellingly.

However, the principle does not meet our usual, Galilean perspectives. Then, we can ask : What is the origin of the principle? What makes the speed of the light constant to everyone? In this work, it is argued that, in mathematically rigorous terms, the principle is almost equivalent to the local causality principle and this can be interpreted as 'Even if time machine exists, it depends not on the local structure but on the global structure, or equivalently, on the topology of our universe.' In mathematical terms, we show that any diffeomorphism between spacetimes is conformal if the diffeomorphism preserves pointwise harmonicity of functions.",

Outside Einstein's relativity, spinning black holes may be different from their general relativistic counterparts, and their merger may then lead to a modified ringdown. We study the latter and, for the first time, derive a modified Teukolsky equation, i.e., a set of linear, decoupled differential equations that describe dynamical perturbations of non-Kerr black holes for the radiative Newman-Penrose scalars Ψ<SUB>0</SUB> and Ψ<SUB>4</SUB>. We first focus on non-Ricci-flat, Petrov type-D black hole backgrounds in modified gravity and derive the modified Teukolsky equation through direct decoupling and through a new approach, proposed by Chandrasekhar, that uses certain gauge conditions. We then extend this analysis to non-Ricci-flat, Petrov type-I black hole backgrounds in modified gravity, assuming they can be treated as a linear perturbation of Petrov type-D , black hole backgrounds in general relativity by generalizing Chandrasekhar's approach, and derive the decoupled modified Teukolsky equation. We further show that our formalism can be extended beyond linear order in both modified gravity corrections and gravitational wave perturbations. Our work lays the foundation to study the gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of black hole coalescence in modified gravity for black holes of any spin. Our work can also be extended to compute gravitational waves emitted by extreme mass-ratio binary inspirals in modified gravity.",

All these results are valid in the context of a Newtonian mechanics which is being developed in the center-of-mass system of all the particles. The conservation of linear momentum, energy, angular momentum are expressed in relational terms, i.e., no reference is made to absolute space.

Bohr's electron rotates with positive kinetic energies +K but has addition negative potential energies - 2K. The total net energy is thus always negative with value - K. Einstein's special relativity requires energies to be positive. There's a Bohr negative energy conflict with Einstein's positive energy requirement. The two men debated the problem. Both would have preferred a different electron model having only positive energies. Bohr and Einstein couldn't find such a model. But Murray Gell-Mann did! In the 1960's, Gell-Mann introduced his loop-shaped string-like electron. Now, analysis with string theory shows that the hydrogen electron is a loop of string-like material with a length equal to the circumference of the circular orbit it occupies. It rotates like a lariat around its centered proton. This loop-shape has no negative potential energies: only positive +K relativistic kinetic energies. Waves induced on loop-shaped electrons propagate their energy at a speed matching the tangential speed of rotation. With matching wave speed and only positive kinetic energies, this loop-shaped electron model is uniquely suited to be governed by the Einstein relativistic equation for total mass-energy. Its calculated photon emissions are all in excellent agreement with experimental data and, of course, in agreement with those -K calculations by Neils Bohr 100 years ago. Problem solved!",

The approach typically gives some picture of a noncommutative (quantum) space time. We propose a formulation with two deformations implemented on the Poincaré symmetry, using the independent Planck mass and Planck length as the invariant constraints. Together, they give the quantum ℏ. The scheme leads to SO(2,4) as the relativity symmetry. We present a linear realization on a classical six-geometry beyond the familiar setting of space time. Two extra coordinates to be considered as neither space nor time are needed. The last deformation step implementing the Planck length invariant constraines the six-geometry, as an extension of 4D space time, giving it the structure of a AdS hypersurface. The resulted quantum world hence does not admit coordinate translation symmetries, which terminates further extension to an unstable symmetry.

It shows how, even if some of these notions do exist in the theory or for some particular solution of it, they appear usually in mutual conflict: they cannot be synthesized coherently, and this is interpreted as the impossibility to construct a common entity which could be called time. This contrasts with the case in Newtonian physics where such a synthesis precisely constitutes Newtonian time. After an illustration by comparing the status of time in Einsteinian physics with that of the vertical direction in Newtonian physics, I will conclude that there is no pertinent notion of time in Einsteinian theories.",

Gravitational/inertial energy-charges of nonlocal carriers depend on their global time-varying interactions with other elementary energy-charges that quantitatively address Machian relativism for gravitation and inertia. Electromagnetic waves change the gravitational/inertial energy-charge that can be tested in the Solar system. The non-empty space paradigm admits geometrization of the radial particle in the 1915 Einstein equation and suggests the similar field-energy nature for the distributed electric charge.",

The Hamilton Least Action Principle states that, for a true/actual trajectory of a system, Hamilton's Action is stationary for the paths, which evolve from the preset initial space-time point to the preset final space-time point. The Hamilton Principle distinguishes between the actual and trial/test trajectories of the system in the configurational space. This enables the transformation of the infinite set of points of the configurational space (available for the system) into the bi-colored, infinite, complete, graph, when the points of the configurational space are seen as the vertices, actual paths connecting the vertices/ points of the configurational space are colored with red; whereas, the trial links/paths are colored with green. Following the Ramsey Infinite Theorem, there exists the infinite, monochromatic sequence of the pathways/clique, which is completely made up of actual or virtual paths, linking the interim states of the system. The same procedure is applicable to the Maupertuis's principle (classical and quantum), Hilbert-Einstein relativistic variational principle and reciprocal variational principles.

According to this approach all physical quantities are described in terms of the continuum spatial coordinates and time. Using general relativity theory a great progress has been made in understanding the evolution of the Universe. Cosmologists usually measure spatial distances and redshitfs of faraway galaxies as expressed by the Hubble expansion. In recent years this fact was undertaken to develop new theories in terms of distances and velocities (redshift). While in Einstein's relativity the propagation of light plays the major role, in the new theory it is the expansion of the Universe that takes that role and appears at the outset. The cosmic time becomes crucial in these recent theories, which in the standard theory is considered to be absolute but here it is relative. In this lecture this new approach to cosmology is presented.",

The possibility of constructing a gauge-invariant action for the Poincar&amp;{acutee} group, which satisfies physical requirements is analyzed. It is shown that the action cannot be obtained for the exact symmetry and it can be constructed for the spontaneously broken symmetry.

The purpose of this paper is to show that metric gravity, as a general concept, is implicitly contained in the idea of the momentum-conserving interaction and is independent of all additional concepts; this, of course, implies that concepts of curved space-time manifolds are strictly superfluous to the function of describing gravitational physics. The basic idea is realizable within the context of either Newtonian mechanics in Galilean space and time or Einstein's relativistic mechanics in Lorentzian space-time, and is illustrated here for the physics of Galileo and Newton; in particular it is shown how Newton's universal theory of gravitation arises as a special case of this analysis.",

Its main goal is to propose a big picture of gravitation, where Einstein's relativity arises as a natural increment to Newton's theory. It is designed for bachelor/master students who do not necessarily have prior knowledge about relativity. The students are nevertheless expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of Newton's mechanics and gravitation, for the first chapter to be a mere reformulation of known concepts. The second chapter then introduces special and general relativity at the same time, while the third chapter explores concrete manifestations of relativistic gravitation, notably gravitational waves and black holes. Each section corresponds, on average, to slightly more than a 2-hour black-board lecture. The numerous exercises must be considered part of the course itself; they are intended to stimulate active reading.",

Moreover, these experiments support the interpretation of the hollow wave as a deformation of the Minkowski space-time geometry.

The decoherence effects of the collapses are in principle detectable if not masked by the overwhelming environmental decoherence. But the DP (or any other, like GRW, CSL) spontaneous collapses are not detectable themselves, they are merely the redundant formalism of spontaneous decoherence. To let DP collapses become testable physics, recently we extended the DP model and proposed that DP collapses are responsible for the emergence of the Newton gravitational force between massive objects. We identified the collapse rate, possibly of the order of 1/ms, with the rate of emergence of the Newton force. A simple heuristic emergence (delay) time was added to the Newton law of gravity. This non-relativistic delay is in peaceful coexistence with Einstein's relativistic theory of gravitation, at least no experimental evidence has so far surfaced against it. We derive new predictions of such a 'lazy' Newton law that will enable decisive laboratory tests with available technologies. The simple equation of 'lazy' Newton law deserves theoretical and experimental studies in itself, independently of the underlying quantum foundational considerations.",

The supremum and infimum needed for dilation and erosion, respectively, are calculated with respect to the Loewner order. Since the result can be outside the bi-cone, a map is proposed to ensure the algebraic closure in the bi-cone. A new addition and subtraction based on Einstein's Relativity Theory is used to define morphological operation such as top-hats, gradients, and morphological Laplacian. Since the addition and subtraction is defined in the unit ball, a suitable mapping between those two spaces is constructed.

Proposals to abandon relativistic symmetry, in the sense of explicitly returning to an absolute time and preferred frame, are rejected on the grounds that the preferred frame is not empirically detectable, so the asymmetry is an unsatisfactory feature in physical theory. A \"symmetric view\" is proposed in which measurement events on space-like separated entangled subsystems are connected by a symmetric two-way mutual influence. Because of this reciprocity, there is complete symmetry of the description: Einsteinian relativity of simultaneity and space-time symmetry are completely preserved. The nature of the two-way influence is considered, as well as the possibility of an empirical test.",

This process was widely used in the development of quantum mechanics since Planck's convention of the discretization of the energy of electromagnetic (EM) waves e = nhf as a solution to the crisis of the blackbody radiation. When combined with Einstein's relativistic particle energy equation e = mc <SUP>2</SUP> it became a most fundamental process of the 20th century theoretical physics. Planck was reluctant to consider his energy quanta e = nhf as a physical particle. His concern was forgotten in the process of development of quantum mechanics, which was Einstein's relativity theory dynamics combined with Planck's wave-particle duality. This framework was later extended by Dirac into the quantization of the entire EM field theory of Maxwell in which the EM fields, which are mathematically a continuous structure, themselves were quantized in terms of Einstein's special theory of relativity dynamics using Fourier expansions. As it appears that the mathematical error of using wave numbers, which form a real continuum, as indexes of the Fourier expansion for the discretization of waves went unnoticed, this quantization of electrodynamics, called quantum electrodynamics (QED), became a model for further quantizing continuum based physical theories. This error was thus passed down to all of the successors of QED. The theory of quantum gravity is yet another attempt to quantize a major force field theory of gravitational forces. Here as well the issue of the difference between the continuum and the discrete was overlooked.",

      "abstract": "The proper description of time remains a key unsolved problem in science. Newton conceived of time as absolute and universal which \"flows equably without relation to anything external.\" In the nineteenth century, the four-dimensional algebraic structure of the quaternions developed by Hamilton, inspired him to suggest that he could provide a unified representation of space and time. With the publishing of Einstein's theory of special relativity these ideas then lead to the generally accepted Minkowski spacetime formulation of 1908. Minkowski, though, rejected the formalism of quaternions suggested by Hamilton and adopted an approach using four-vectors. The Minkowski framework is indeed found to provide a versatile formalism for describing the relationship between space and time in accordance with Einstein's relativistic principles, but nevertheless fails to provide more fundamental insights into the nature of time itself. In order to answer this question we begin by exploring the geometric properties of three-dimensional space that we model using Clifford geometric algebra, which is found to contain sufficient complexity to provide a natural description of spacetime. This description using Clifford algebra is found to provide a natural alternative to the Minkowski formulation as well as providing new insights into the nature of time. Our main result is that time is the scalar component of a Clifford space and can be viewed as an intrinsic geometric property of three-dimensional space without the need for the specific addition of a fourth dimension.",

Not Band-Aids, but revolutionary new ways of conceptualizing physics, in the spirit of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. This paper identifies a number of long-held, but unproven assumptions currently being challenged by an increasing number of alternative scientists. Two common themes, both with venerable histories, keep recurring in the many alternative theories being proposed: (1) Mach's Principle, and (2) toroidal, vortex particles. Matter-based Mach's Principle differs from both space-based universal frames and observer-based Einsteinian relativity. Toroidal particles, in addition to explaining electron spin and the fundamental constants, satisfy the basic requirement of Gauss's misunderstood B Law, that motion itself circulates. Though a comprehensive theory is beyond the scope of this paper, it will suggest alternatives to the long list of assumptions in context.",

The Ehlers-Pirani-Schild scheme of operationally determining the geometry of space-time, using freely falling classical particle trajectories, is done using operations in an infinitesimal neighborhood around each point. The study of the free fall of a quantum wave suggests a quantum principle of equivalence. The principle of general covariance is clarified. The sign change of a Fermion field when rotated by $2\\pi$ radians is used to argue for a quantum mechanical modification of space-time, which leads naturally to supersymmetry. A novel effect in quantum gravity due to the author is used to extend Einstein's hole argument to quantum gravity. This suggests a quantum principle of general covariance, according to which the fundamental laws of physics should be covariant under `quantum diffeomorphisms'. This heuristic principle implies that space-time points have no invariant meaning in quantum gravity.",

It was believed that the temperature of the early Universe was once 300 GeV, or higher, at $10^{-11} sec$, and then going through the electroweak phase transition. But the mass phase transition happens in the purely imaginary temperature. Later on, its temperature was 150 MeV at $3.3 \\times 10^{-5} sec$, and then going through the \"QCD cosmological phase transition\". We attempt to use the Standard Model, a completely dimensionless theory apart from the negative \"ignition\" term, to conclude that the EW or mass phase transition {\\it does not exist}. On the front of QCD cosmological phase transition, the intriguing question about the latent heat (energy) is discussed and its role is speculated.",

Our results here show, using only basic natural assumptions on dynamics, that this definition is the only possible way to get a consistent theory of such particles moving within the geometry of Minkowskian spacetime. We present a strictly formal proof from a streamlined axiom system that given any slow or fast inertial particle, all inertial observers agree on the value of {m}\\cdot √{|1-v^2|}, where {m} is the particle's relativistic mass and vits speed. This confirms formally the widely held belief that the relativistic mass and momentum of a positive-mass faster-than-light particle must decrease as its speed increases.",

The Minkowski and Abraham models of refractive index p‧=nE/c and p‧=E/(nc), respectively, require that E‧=E and E‧=n<SUP>2</SUP>E, respectively.

A common approach is to manually create mathematical models of natural phenomena using domain knowledge, and then fit these models to data. In contrast, machine-learning algorithms automate the construction of accurate data-driven models while consuming large amounts of data. The problem of incorporating prior knowledge in the form of constraints on the functional form of a learned model (e.g., nonnegativity) has been explored in the literature. However, finding models that are consistent with prior knowledge expressed in the form of general logical axioms (e.g., conservation of energy) is an open problem. We develop a method to enable principled derivations of models of natural phenomena from axiomatic knowledge and experimental data by combining logical reasoning with symbolic regression. We demonstrate these concepts for Kepler's third law of planetary motion, Einstein's relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir's theory of adsorption, automatically connecting experimental data with background theory in each case. We show that laws can be discovered from few data points when using formal logical reasoning to distinguish the correct formula from a set of plausible formulas that have similar error on the data. The combination of reasoning with machine learning provides generalizeable insights into key aspects of natural phenomena. We envision that this combination will enable derivable discovery of fundamental laws of science and believe that our work is an important step towards automating the scientific method.",

We discuss how the Poincaré-Snyder relativity may provide a stronger framework for the description of the usual (Einstein) relativistic quantum mechanics and beyond. In particular, we discuss a geometric quantization picture through the U(1) central extension of the relativity group, which had been establish to work well for the Galilean case but not for the Einstein case. We discuss similarities and differences between our Poincaré-Snyder picture with a still not fully understood $\\sigma$ variable as the `evolution' parameter and some use of an invariant time or the proper time parameter in some earlier formulations with very similar mathematical structure. The study is a first step towards the investigation of physics of the $\\sigma$ variable at the Poincaré-Snyder setting, plausible leading to experimental signatures to be studied.",

In line of principle, this theory may be proposed as a valid alternative to the current views assuming the dominance of dark matter and inflationary scenarios. In this work, the relativistic transformation of the Poynting vector associated with the reception of electromagnetic waves emitted by astronomical obiects is derived in the context of the special version of the theory. On the basis of this result, and some heuristic assumptions, two recent collections of observational data are analyzed.",

      "abstract": "The physical mystery behind the constancy of the velocity of light is solved after the bias blind spot of Einstein's relativistic physics was illuminated precisely. We have given the physical law f = c/λ. The relative frequency shifts of the longitudinal Doppler effect are calculated from the frequency ratio of the frequency f r at the receiver and the frequency f e at the emitter. The very small frequency shift of the so-called relativistic time dilation factor can be neglected for low velocities. Comparing electromagnetic radiation, when receiver and emitter are at rest, the wavelengths must be the same and are canceling, so that we obtain: f r/f e = (c/λ r)/c/λ e) = c/c = 1/1. If the relative velocity c of light were constant in any inertial frame, independent of the motion of the receiver and emitter, no shift of wavelength and frequency would be possible. Einstein's special relativity excludes the possibility of the longitudinal Doppler effect. The longitudinal Doppler effect is explained according to relativity in dependence of gravity (RG), by which Einstein's illogical relativity is replaced. Why do we always measure the constant velocity c on Earth is now physically understandable.",

As light consist of quanta, it is only logical that gravitational quanta interact with light. In my article \"Cognitive bias in physics with respect to Einstein's relativity, demonstrated by the famous experiment of Pound and Rebka (1960), which in reality refutes Einstein's general relativity\" [R. G. Ziefle, Phys. Essays 35, 91 (2022)], I could demonstrate that Einstein's \"proper time\" t 0 does not refer to reference frames but to gravitational potentials. That is why \"Newtonian quantum gravity\" [R. G. Ziefle, Phys. Essays 33, 99 (2020)] can predict the correct curvature of a light beam at the surface of the Sun. Also, the phenomena observed at the binary pulsar PSR B1913 + 16 can precisely be predicted by merely applying Kepler's second law. If gravitational quanta move away from masses with the constant speed c of light, this coincides with Einstein's postulate of a constant speed c of light with respect to reference frames, as a mass, such as a star or a planet, can also be defined as a reference frame. Therefore, Einstein's found by chance an artificial and complicated method to calculate changes in space-time caused by motion, which are in reality additional gravitational effects caused by the relative velocity between gravitational quanta emitted by masses and other masses or photons.",

In nonholonomic variables, the bulk gravity is described by Finsler modifications depending on velocity/momentum coordinates. Possible super-luminal phenomena are determined by the width of locally anisotropic brane (spacetime) and induced by generating functions and integration functions and constants in coefficients of metrics and nonlinear connections. We conclude that Finsler brane gravity trapping mechanism may explain neutrino super-luminal effects and almost preserve the paradigm of Einstein relativity as the standard one for particle physics and gravity.",

In particular, mergers of stellar black holes are the main targets of the current gravitational wave experiments. In order to make accurate predictions, it is however necessary to simulate the mergers in numerical general relativity, which requires high performance computing. While scaling relations are used to rescale simulations for very massive black holes, primordial black holes have specific properties which can invalidate the rescaling. Similarly black holes in theories beyond Einstein's relativity can have different scaling properties. In this article, we consider scaling relations for the most general cases of primordial black holes, such as charged and spinned black holes, and study the effects of the cosmological expansion and of Hawking evaporation. We also consider more exotic black hole models and derive the corresponding scaling relations, which can be compared to the observations in order to identify the underlying black hole model and can be used to rescale the numerical simulations of exotic black hole mergers.",

The best and brighest physicist of the last 80 years have tried to answer the quantization question and gotten answers that while interesting, like loop quantum gravity and string/M theory, have not be accepted by all as being the answer. In this talk it will be proposed that the better question to ask is how can we realtivize quantum field theory. Relativization means to make a theory comply with Einsteins relativity. QFT is a result of the relativization of quantum theory. Quantum gravity would be the result of a sort of reverse relativization of General Relativity so we can quantize it. It may be that nature does not work that way. It may be that the unified theory of GR+QFT will be realtivized. In this talk I will briefly state the five axioms of realtivization, and show how to write the relativized standard model and use it to make predictions for particle physics and astrophysical observations.",

We also obtained boundary conditions for this type of curves. Moreover, the minimization problem of the energy which occurs with an applied force on an elastic line was discussed. Then, we researched the formed potential energy due to the applied force. Also, during the calculation of the potential energy on the elastic line, the amount of the potential energy for unit length of the elastic line was used.

Intervals along time-like trajectories, and their associated causal diamonds, completely characterize a Lorentzian geometry. The Bekenstein-Hawking-Gibbons-'t Hooft-Jacobson-Fischler-Susskind-Bousso Covariant Entropy Principle, equates the logarithm of the dimension of the Hilbert space associated with a diamond to one quarter of the area of the diamond's holographic screen, measured in Planck units. The most convincing argument for this principle is Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations as the hydrodynamic expression of this entropy law. In that context, the null energy condition (NEC) is seen to be the analog of the local law of entropy increase. The quantum version of Einstein's relativity principle is a set of constraints on the mutual quantum information shared by causal diamonds along different time-like trajectories. The implementation of this constraint for trajectories in relative motion is the greatest unsolved problem in HST. The other key feature of HST is its claim that, for non-negative cosmological constant or causal diamonds much smaller than the asymptotic radius of curvature for negative c.c., the degrees of freedom localized in the bulk of a diamond are constrained states of variables defined on the holographic screen. This principle gives a simple explanation of otherwise puzzling features of BH entropy formulae, and resolves the firewall problem for black holes in Minkowski space. It motivates a covariant version of the CKN [1] bound on the regime of validity of quantum field theory (QFT) and a detailed picture of the way in which QFT emerges as an approximation to the exact theory.",

Mannheim's scalar field, S, can be quantized around the minimum of the effective potential. We obtain a natural set of modes and states by requiring conformal invariance of the equation of motion; this fixes the coefficient of the R<SUP>μ</SUP><SUB> μ</SUB> term in the action, and results in a G<SUB>eff</SUB> that is positive.

      ],
      "abstract": "The second flavor of hydrogen atoms (SFHA) refers to the kind of hydrogen atoms that have only the states of the zero orbital angular momentum (the S-states), both in the discrete and continuous spectra. They were first discovered theoretically in one of my earlier papers, where a proof of their existence was also provided by analyzing atomic experiments concerning the high-energy tail of the linear momentum distribution in the ground state of hydrogen atoms. From a theoretical point of view, the discovery was based on the standard Dirac equation for hydrogen atoms without changing the existing physical laws. Recently, the existence of the SFHA was seemingly also confirmed by two types of astrophysical observations: the allowance for the SFHA explained the puzzling results concerning both the anomalous absorption of the redshifted 21 cm spectral line from the early Universe, and the observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) team where it was found that the distribution of dark matter in the Universe is noticeably smoother than predictions employing Einstein's relativity. In the present review, we exhibit results from two recent papers where attention was brought to a visible difference in the cross-sections of the resonant charge exchange for collisions of the SFHA with incoming protons, compared to collisions of the usual hydrogen atoms with incoming protons. It was shown that, after taking into account the SFHA, there is a better agreement with the corresponding experimental cross-section. Coupled with the previous evidence of the existence of the SFHA, deduced from the analysis of the other kind of atomic experiments, and evidenced by two different kinds of astrophysical observations, this strengthens the standing of the SFHA as the most probable candidate for all or a part of dark matter.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to Einstein's relativity theories, our notions of space and time underwent profound revisions about a 100 years ago. The resulting interplay between geometry and physics has dominated all of fundamental physics since then. This volume contains contributions from leading researchers, worldwide, who have thought deeply about the nature and consequences of this interplay. The articles take a long-range view of the subject and distill the most important advances in broad terms, making them easily accessible to non-specialists. The first part is devoted to a summary of how relativity theories were born (J. Stachel). The second part discusses the most dramatic ramifications of general relativity, such as black holes (P. Chrusciel and R. Price), space-time singularities (H. Nicolai and A. Rendall), gravitational waves (P. Laguna and P. Saulson), the large scale structure of the cosmos (T. Padmanabhan); experimental status of this theory (C. Will) as well as its practical application to the GPS system (N. Ashby). The last part looks beyond Einstein and provides glimpses into what is in store for us in the 21st century. Contributions here include summaries of radical changes in the notions of space and time that are emerging from quantum field theory in curved space-times (Ford), string theory (T. Banks), loop quantum gravity (A. Ashtekar), quantum cosmology (M. Bojowald), discrete approaches (Dowker, Gambini and Pullin) and twistor theory (R Penrose).",

According to this approach all physical quantities are described in terms of the continuum spatial coordinates and time. Using general relativity theory a great progress has been made in understanding the evolution of the Universe. Cosmologists usually measure spatial distances and redshifts of faraway galaxies as expressed by the Hubble expansion. In recent years this fact was undertaken to develop new theories in terms of distances and velocities (redshift). While in Einstein's relativity the propagation of light plays the major role, in the new theory it is the expansion of the Universe that takes that role and appears at the outset. The cosmic time becomes crucial in these recent theories, which in the standard theory is considered to be absolute but here it is relative. In this lecture this new approach to cosmology is presented.",

Like Einstein for relativistic kinematics we start from vivid measurement operations and simple natural principles. Seeking, formulating and refining operational definitions reveals the physical meaning. We grasp the basic observables (length, duration, inertial mass, momentum, energy) in a physical way. We define an order of energy and impulse from a physical comparison. Each step (the construction of \"sufficiently constant\" reference devices and of a machinery, which \"functions\" for a basic measurement) follows from practical requirements. One can directly count the tangible measurement units and ultimately derive the fundamental equations (e.g. the kinetic energy-velocity relation or the mass-energy equivalence).",

This study is essentially concerned with the relativistic mass, where the Lorentz factor transforms the state of the second-order differential equation of an NDHO from linear into nonlinear. The results are finally confirmed by demonstrating energy conservation since the sum of kinetic and potential energies remains constant throughout the non relativistic and relativistic regimes.",

Einstein's relativity is a principal contributor to the overarching LambdaCDM model from the Big Bang to present time. Now empirical constraints and discoveries ranging from observed wide-binary/spiral galaxy rotation flattening to cosmic acceleration and the Hubble tension point to extended space-time physics encompassing (again) all scales. Here we build on derived cosmic acceleration (2019/20) and the related derivation of wide-binary/spiral galaxy rotation flattening (2017/20; setting aside ``external field effect'' for now) to show that the ``round-trip axiom'' holds in the accelerating Hubble-expansion (as it holds in Michelson-Morley type experiments). This step is a further validation of ``inward-singular light-speed'' to each point (with half-c outward) that introduces novel time-dilation/gravitational fields while accommodating conventional mathematical physics. Additional results bearing on quantum mechanics' temporal entanglement and the long-standing measurement problem are addressed.",

In addition, we generalize the thermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the corresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the $g_{tt}$ element. Moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physical properties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which shows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The obtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a polytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background. We also show that if one considers the Misner-Sharp mass in the calculations, the Schwarzschild metric will be got. The relationship between the two mass definitions in each metric is studied. The results of considering the geometrical surface gravity are also addressed. Our investigation shows that the geometrical surface gravity's definition is not always compatible with the validity of the first law of thermodynamics on the horizons of spherically symmetric static metrics.",

In particular, almost all the matter content in the Universe is given by dark matter, which dominates the mass budget and drives the dynamics of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Unfortunately, dark matter and dark energy have not been detected and no direct or indirected observations have allowed to prove their existence and amount. For this reason, some authors have suggested that a modification of Einstein Relativity or the change of the Newton's dynamics law (within a relativistic and classical framework, respectively) could allow to replace these unobserved components. We will start discussing the role of dark matter in the early-type galaxies, mainly in their central regions, investigating how its content changes as a function of the mass and the size of each galaxy and few considerations about the stellar Initial mass function have been made. In the second part of the paper we have described, as examples, some ways to overcome the dark matter hypothesis, by fitting to the observations the modified dynamics coming out from general relativistic extended theories and the MOdyfled Newtonian dynamics (MOND).",

      "abstract": "The strange visual appearance of objects is one of the puzzling predictions of Einstein's relativity. This is mainly due to the distinction between measuring and seeing, where the former is described by the Lorentz Transformation and the latter considers the time light rays (emitted by each point on the object) take to reach the observer. We compute the apparent position of a point given its velocity, initial position, and observation time. The apparent speed of a point is calculated, and we obtain that it exceeds the speed of light when approaching the observer, similar to superluminal motion. For parameterizable surfaces, we analyze properties (such as curvature and torsion) of apparent shapes. The observation that a sphere retains its circular silhouette when transformed to its apparent shape, independent of the initial conditions, is proved mathematically. Plots describing the apparent speed and length of objects are made, and the metric tensor for a distorted sphere is calculated. A generalized equation for the Doppler effect and relativistic aberration is derived to analyze regions of redshift and blueshift. Using the Born-rigidity conditions, we compute the hyperbolic trajectories of each point on an extended object given an initial velocity, position, and proper acceleration for any reference point. The claim that a rigid body, accelerating in Special Relativity, cannot exceed a given length in certain circumstances is justified. We obtain many non-trivial results, which are proved algebraically and using light cones, that are tested by taking the limit of acceleration approaching 0 to retrieve results in the constant velocity scenario. In conclusion, these visualizations may be used by teachers to explain SR intuitively. Finally, we provide an overview of extending the same problem to curved spacetime and explain the potential applications of this project.",

Entropy 2017, 19, 345) on the deductive formulation of a physical theory based on explicitly- and universally-introduced basic concepts is further developed. An entropic measure of time with a number of properties leading to an analog of the Galileo-Einstein relativity principle is considered. Using this measure and a simple model, a kinematic law which relates time to the size and number of particles of a system is obtained. Corollaries of this law are examined. In particular, accelerated growth of the system size is obtained, whereas in systems with constant size, a decrease in the number of particles is observed. An interesting corollary is the emergence of repulsive and attractive forces inversely proportional to the square of the system size for relatively dense systems and constant for systems with sufficiently low density.",

Recently, the superluminal behavior of a high-power ultrashort laser pulse is of great interest. In this presentation, analytic expression for an electric field describing a superluminal/subluminal femtosecond(fs) laser focus has been presented for a fs laser pulse with an orbital angular momentum (OAM). The analytic expression for a spatio-temporal field distribution is obtained through a diffraction integral plugged by a time-dependent longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) under the paraxial approximation and its Fourier transformation. It shows that the speed and the pulse duration of a laser focus depends on the group delay dispersion and a chromaticity parameter determined by the LCA of a focusing optic. The expression is applied to show the generation of a several fs superluminal OAM laser focus. <P />The work was supported by the project High Field Initiative (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15 003/0000449) from the European Regional Development Fund.",

The amplitude of the wave ($R$) is found to satisfy the Schrödinger equation while the phase ($S$) is related to the energy conservation. Besides the quantum potential that depends on $R$, \\emph{viz.}, $V_Q=-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\nabla^2R}{R}$\\,, we have obtained a phase potential $V_S=-\\frac{S\\nabla^2S}{m}$ that depends on the phase $S$ derivative. The phase force is a dissipative force. The quantum potential may be attributed to the interaction between the two subfields $S$ and $R$ comprising the quantum particle. This results in splitting (creation/annihilation) of these subfields, each having a mass $mc^2$ with an internal frequency of $2mc^2/\\hbar$, satisfying the original wave equation and endowing the particle its quantum nature. The mass of one subfield reflects the interaction with the other subfield. If in Bohmian ansatz $R$ satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation, then $S$ must satisfies the wave equation. Conversely, if $R$ satisfies the wave equation, then $S$ yields the Einstein relativistic energy momentum equation.",

Regarding these I shall make the following remark: although the periodicity as an interpretation of the elementary quantum of electricity occured to me almost at the beginning (in 1925) and later led me to the consideration of the corresponding group, from early times until recently I oscillated between this way and a formalism related to isospin, obtained by cutting down the higher harmonics of the Fourier expansion. This, however led to two difficulties: the linearity in the momenta in the Lagrangian density could not be maintained unless the group was limited in analogy to the transformation group (10); and, that the equivalence claim could not be satisfied. With the full periodicity these difficulties are absent.",

      "abstract": "A century ago, \"past\" and \"future\", previously strictly apart, mixed up and merged. Temporal terminology improved. Today, not actualized quantum states, that is merely \"possible\" alternatives, objectively \"exist\" (are real) when they interfere. Again, two previously strictly immiscible realms mix. Now, modal terminology is insufficient. Both times, extreme reactions reach from rejection of the empirical science to mystic holism. This paper shows how progress started with the relativization of previously absolute terms, first through Einstein's relativity and now through Everett's relative state description, which is a modal realism. The historical parallels suggest mere relativization is insufficient. A deformation of domains occurs: The determined past and the dependent future were restricted to smaller regions of space-time. This light cone description is superior to hyperspace foliations and already entails the modal realism of quantum mechanics. Moreover, an entirely new region, namely the \"absolute elsewhere\" was identified. The historical precedent suggests that modal terminology may need a similar extension. Discussing the modal realistic connection underlying both relativities, Popper's proof of future indeterminism is turned to shatter the past already into many worlds/minds, thus Everett relativity is merely the Bell inequality violating correlation between possible empirical records.",

The cream of international science, an impressive list of dignitaries including the Prince Consort, and thousands of ordinary people turned out to see Lorentz being carried to his last resting place. This biography describes the life of Lorentz, from his early childhood as the son of a market gardener in the provincial town of Arnhem, to his death as a leading light in physics and international scientific cooperation and a trailblazer for Einstein's relativity theory. A number of chapters shed light on his unique place in science, the importance of his ideas, his international conciliatory and scientific activities after World War One, his close friendship with Albert Einstein, and his important role as Einstein's teacher and intellectual critic. By making use of recently discovered family correspondence, the author was able to show that there lies a true human being behind Lorentz's façade of perfection. One chapter is devoted to Lorentz's wife Aletta, a woman in her own right whose progressive feminist ideas were of considerable influence on those of her husband. Two separate chapters focus on his most important scientific achievements, in terms accessible to a general audience.",

Two families of potentials coexist as mathematical solutions for the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation which is the same homogeneous classical wave equation: (a) Neo-Laplacian local time-independent background potentials, and (b) Novel time-distance entangled Q(q) potentials which are isomorph to distance-time-velocity transformations based on any of the competing relativistic theories (Lorentz, Poincaré or Einstein), or on the pre-relativistic Galilean invariant Doppler equations. This remarkable property makes present theory compatible with all previous empirical evidence, including experiments conventionally interpreted as supporting Einstein's special relativity. We report explicit closed solutions for potentials solving the one-dimensional and three-dimensional classical wave equations, and describe in detail how to calculate time-independent neo-Laplacian background forces and relativistically isomorph time-dependent entangled forces. The scale of the problem appears as a required parameter, thus making our theory applicable to all scales of Nature from quarks to cosmos. A usually overlooked neo-Laplacian logarithmic potential predicts the observed high values of non-Keplerian tangential speeds at the galactic scale. At the human scale, calculations relative to hurricanes and tornadoes may be facilitated by the closed form of our unified forces. A novel torsion component of gravity automatically appears from our new solutions.",

Laws such as the classical Lorentz force and Einstein's relativistic kinematics were established before the rise of quantum mechanics. Later, it became crucial to measure the energy loss of charged particles in matter. In 1930, Bethe developed a semi-classical model based on the quantum mechanics of scattering. In the early 1930s, he and others calculated the passage of charged particles through matter including pair creation and bremsstrahlung. Due to missing trust in quantum electrodynamics, however, only semi-empirical methods were employed in order to estimate the mass and charge from the features of particle tracks. In 1932, Anderson inserted a lead plate into the cloud chamber in order to determine the flight direction and charge of the `positive electron'. In the 1940s, nuclear emulsions helped to resolve puzzles about particle identification and quantum electrodynamics. Later, the measurement theory was extended in a cumulative process by adding conservation laws for dynamic properties, probabilistic quantum formulas for resonances, scattering cross sections, etc. The measurement method was taken over from cosmic ray studies to the era of particle accelerators, and finally taken back from there to astroparticle physics. The measurement methods remained the same, but in the transition from particle to astroparticle physics the focus of interest shifted. Indeed, the experimental methods of both fields explore the grounds of `new physics' in complementary ways.",

This occurs in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. In the latter case, discontinuous variations also appear without changing the setup, when the Lorentzian reference frame is changed.",

The velocity control is achieved by varying the pulse front tilt angle. Simulations demonstrate that such fronts can serve as efficient Doppler-type converters of terahertz pulses. In particular, the pulse reflected from a front, generated by three-photon absorption of a Ti:sapphire laser in ZnS, can exhibit strong (up to more than an order of magnitude) pulse compression and spectrum broadening without a noticeable amplitude change. The proposed technique may be used to convert strong low-frequency terahertz pulses, generated by optical rectification of tilted-pulse-front laser pulses, to desirable temporal and spectral characteristics for a variety of applications.",

In this paper it is shown that in the multifractal theory of time and space the corrections of general relativity to Newton gravitational forces are explaining very simple in Newton approach. It is shown also that there is dependence (though very small) of bodies gravitational acceleration from their masses, so the principle of equivalence in multifractal universe is not absolute and it is only a very good approach.

Introducing the notions of effective speed and reliability of superluminal devices, we encourage experimenters to set and break world records in this new branch. At the same time we outline a mechanism (termed 'particle encapsulation') owing to which nature theory remains Lorentz invariant and so consistent with experiments. From among other numerous applications of nature theory we discuss briefly local antigravitation and new computing machines, called 'vacuum computers', applying 'cat principle'.

In this letter, we present two different techniques providing complementary ways of testing new physics beyond the Λ CDM cosmological paradigm. First, we shall present some of the latest progress and shortcomings in the cosmographic model-independent approach for several modified gravity theories using supernovae catalogues, baryonic acoustic oscillation data and H ( z ) differential age compilations. Second, we shall show how once the Einsteinian paradigm is abandoned, the phenomenology of neutron stars changes dramatically since neutron-star masses can be much larger than their General Relativity counterparts. Consequently, the total energy available for radiating gravitational waves could be of the order of several solar masses, and thus a merger of these stars constitutes a privileged wave source. Unfortunately at the present time our persisting lack of understanding in the strong interaction sector does not allow to distinguish the alternative theories from the usual General Relativity predictions.",

This situation guides to create a space topology in meshed with IPs. The resulted space is named Inflective Space, IS. Waves around IPs are studied from a point of view to coordinate inflective shapes. The Inflective Coordinates Systems, ICSs are useful to compute the exact solutions. The differential equations are solved with extending the usual separation method after obtaining them in ICSs. These extensions bring out inflective special functions and series. The achieved results give the exact meaning of physics, say Truly True Truth, TTT related with IPs. The waves are calculated around IP propagating from the charges moving near IPs. The photon model, field equations of Einstein's relativistic gravitation theory, and relativistic Schrödinger wave equation in an empty IS, including inflective boundaries, are studied with inflective series and solutions are obtained by applying the extracted separation method in both circularly and/or spherically ICSs. The extracted separation method comes with some modifications on extended separation method. The approach extracts TTT.",

The history of science tells us that when the creative effort of physicists and philosophers to solve the main puzzles of the understanding of our universe met, a new conceptual revolution has started. However, since Einstein's relativistic theories and the subsequent advent of quantum mechanics, physicists and philosophers have taken different paths, both kidnapped by the intrinsic conceptual and mathematical difficulties inherited by their studies. Is it possible to restore a unitary vision of knowledge, overcoming the scientific-humanistic dichotomy that has established itself over time? The answer is certainly not trivial, but we can start from school to experience a new vision of a unified knowledge. From this need, the Gravitas project has born. Gravitas is a multidisciplinary outreach and educational program devoted to high school students (17-19 years old) that mixes contemporary physics and the philosophy of science. Coordinated by the Cagliari Section of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics, in Italy, Gravitas has started on December 2021 with an unconventional online format: two researchers coming from different fields of research meet a moderator and informally discuss about gravity and related phenomena. The public can chat and indirectly interact with them during the YouTube live. The project involved about 250 students from 16 high schools in Sardinia, Italy. Students should also create posts thought for social media whose content is based on the seminars they attended during the project. We present the project and discuss its possible outcomings concerning the introduction of a multidisciplinary approach in teaching physics, philosophy, and the history of contemporary physics in high schools.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this thesis is to summarize the results of several research projects completed by the author during his graduate studies. Chapter one contains a thorough analysis of the problem of non-inertial frames of reference in quantum mechanics. The generally covariant Dirac equation and its non-relativistic limit are studied. It is shown that most results contained in literature are incorrect or incomplete. Quantum physics in a uniformly rotating frame is discussed in connection with neutron interferometry experiments. Chapter two addresses the well known problem of divergences in relativistic quantum field theory. A partial answer to the problem is found. Using the Fock space built on the non-perturbative vacuum in an external magnetic field, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron in the second order perturbation approximation is calculated with no resulting divergent integrals. This formalism has many applications (e.g. magnetars, pulsars) in the physics of intense external fields in quantum electrodynamics. The last chapter addresses a fundamental question in physics, \"What is the physical nature of space-time?\" The homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate is studied as a possible space-time medium. Motions of classical impurities in this medium are examined in the framework of the second quantization method. The general solution is obtained, and several examples are worked out in detail. These results lead to conclusions that support the hypothesis of the existence of microscopic constituents underlying the emergent space-time. The results obtained suggest that Einstein's relativity could be an emergent theory arising from the non-relativistic quantum many-body system. Accelerated impurities are studied in connection with the Unruh effect. No thermal spectra are found in this model.",

      "abstract": "The 1919 British astronomical expedition led by Arthur Stanley Eddington to observe the deflection of starlight by the sun, as predicted by Einstein's relativistic theory of gravitation, is a fascinating example of the importance of expert testimony in the social transmission of scientific knowledge. While Popper lauded the expedition as science at its best, accounts by Earman and Glymour, Collins and Pinch, and Waller are more critical of Eddington's work. Here I revisit the eclipse expedition to dispute the characterization of the British response to general relativity as the blind acceptance of a partisan's pro-relativity claims by colleagues incapable of criticism. Many factors served to make Eddington the trusted British expert on relativity in 1919, and his experimental results rested on debatable choices of data analysis, choices criticized widely since but apparently not widely by his British contemporaries. By attending to how and to whom Eddington presented his testimony and how and by whom this testimony was received, I suggest, we may recognize as evidentially significant corroborating testimony from those who were expert not in relativity but in observational astronomy. We are reminded that even extraordinary expert testimony is neither offered nor accepted entirely in an epistemic vacuum.",

In relation to the human brain therefore, both of these quantities can be used to represent the stored information. The human brain makes use of energy efficiency to form its structures, which is likely to be linked to the neuron wiring. This energy efficiency can also be used as the basis for a clustering algorithm, which is described in a different paper. This paper is more of a discussion about global properties, where the rules used for the clustering algorithm can also create the entropy equation E = (mean * variance). This states that work is done through the energy released by the 'change' in entropy. The equation is so simplistic and generic that it can offer arguments for completely different domains, where the journey ends with a discussion about global energy properties in physics and beyond. A comparison with Einstein's relativity equation is made and also the audacious suggestion that a black hole has zero-energy inside.",

      "abstract": "The disintegration of the solar planetary system is quantitatively modeled, and the implications for the disintegration of planetary stellar systems, the galaxies, and of the universe are shown. Since their formation, the sun, stars, galaxies, and the Universe have been loosing mass by radiation. The radiative mass loss causes a proportional loss of gravity of these entities, and as a consequence, a loss of cohesion of these systems. Sun, stars, and galaxies, in addition, loose mass by solar wind and equivalent processes. Planetary orbital changes of the solar system are calculated as a function of time using radiative and solar wind mass loss. The calculations predict that Pluto, Earth, and Mercury will separate from the solar system in 1.34, 52.8, and 137.0 billion years (Byr), respectively. Presently these planets are predicted to separate at a rate of 4.42, 2.84E-03, and 4.21E-04 km/yr. This increases the orbital periods of Pluto, Earth, and Mercury by 15.9, 9.09E-04, and 8.35E-05 s/year, which translates for Earth to about 0.9 seconds per thousand years. Results for all planets are presented. Radiative loss of mass and gravity of stellar systems results in the loss of cohesion of galaxies, causing them to expand. The radiative loss of mass and gravity of galaxies reduces their cohesion, and thus reduces the cohesion of the Universe. Consequently, the Universe is predicted to expand due to the radiative mass and gravity loss of its stellar and galactic constituents. The model predicts that the Universe initially expanded at a lower rate than presently, which has been observed experimentally. It is further shown that an initial slow expansion is followed by linear expansion in agreement with the Hubble constant. Einstein's relativistic gravity doubling provides a solution to the problem of the contraction of the universe. This effect is based on the theory of relativity and on experimental observations, which show that, photons carry twice the gravity of the mass from which they originate. Thus, the gravity of the universe is increasing by the radiative decay of mass. Absorption by black holes provides a mechanism for the concentration of the radiation and its associated gravity. It also provides a rational for the eventual collapse of the universe without the necessity of dark matter. Previous models of the Universe hypothesize that its stability and that of its constituents depends on negative and dark energies, dark matter, or interaction with parallel universes. The present model of radiative mass and gravity loss is based on established science and avoids hypothetical and experimentally unconfirmed effects.",

      "abstract": "All physical systems balance. In energy and angular momentum terms, a galaxy is as balanced as a flywheel. The scandal in modern physics is that Einstein presented his theory of relativity in such a way that no balancing influence - indeed, no physical influence whatsoever - can pass between bodies faster than the speed of light. This makes it seem miraculous that the physical world holds together in the way it does without \"spooky superluminal actions-at-a-distance\" being responsible for this holistic integrity. Some believe, therefore, as did Einstein - that relativity makes no provision for any such nonlocal interaction; hence the steadily growing number of experimental evidences of such interaction seems to disprove relativity. The authors think this is a confusion created by Einstein's unnecessary interpretation of the constant c as the \"velocity of light in vacuo\". In relativity, proper-time-instantaneity provides all that is necessary for balanced holistic interaction. The authors therefore support relativity from the standpoint of modern philosophy, the only departure being to replace Einstein's velocity of light with Bondi's more economical interpretation of c as a constant for converting observational distances in meters into times in seconds. Without affecting the value and dimensions of c, this profoundly alters the philosophical consequences of the theory, making it more conceptually economical and more compatible with the ideas of Einstein's philosophical mentor and critic, Mach, regarding the instantaneity of distant gravitational and inertial interaction. The authors regard the conservation laws as sufficient in themselves to explain the motions of bodies in relation to one another without need of forces acting between them, either at or faster than the speed of light. This paper is part of an ongoing mathematics/philosophy project at Keele University, both the strength and weakness of which lie in the combining of arts and science in a way that is as difficult to place, academically, as to fund.",

What is usually referred to as the block universe then emerges by noting that part of the future is contained in the present, but without the limitations that the four-dimensional block universe usually implies, of a reality in which change would be impossible. In our operational approach, reality remains dynamic, with free choice playing a central role in its conceptualization. We therefore claim that Einstein's relativity revolution has not been fully realized, since most physicists do not seem to be open to the idea that objects move not only in space, but also and especially in time, and more generally in spacetime, with their rest mass being a measure of their kinetic time energy. When relativistic motion is revisited as a genuine four-dimensional motion, it becomes possible to reinterpret the parameter c associated with the coordinate speed of light, which becomes the magnitude of the four-velocity of all material entities. We also observe that the four-dimensional motion in Minkowski space can be better understood if placed in the broader perspective of quantum mechanics, if non-locality is interpreted as non-spatiality, thus indicating the existence of an underlying non-spatial reality, the nature of which could be conceptual, consistent with the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics. This hypothesis is reinforced by noting that when observers, or experiencers, as they will be referred to in this article, are described by acknowledging their cognitive nature, of entities moving in a semantic space, Minkowski metric emerges in a natural way.",

To obtain this common syntax, we will define the {\\it extended Lorentz group}, which is defined to preserve the volume form of the Minkowski spacetime. The Schwarzschild spacetime will be defined as a manifold associated to a set of radial fields of velocities within of the four-dimensional Minkowski vectorially space form. Our procedure includes a comparison of the Newtonian and the Schwarzschild times along geodesic lines. Our constructions have strong influence of the Einstein paper about the energy content produced by fields, as well as by the Schrödinger digression about the annihilation of matter. We define the orbital associated to the Kepler's laws as a set of elliptical orbits, which have equal eccentricity and equal major semi-axis. Then identifying the eccentricity with the relativistic velocity we will obtain a thermodynamic equivalence between the increasing of mass in kinetic form in special relativity theory and an adiabatic process with degree of freedom equal to 2. The eccentricity will be the needed velocity to move the revolution ellipsoid and so to obtain a contraction of its major axis such that it converts into a sphere with radius given by the minor semi-axis. Therefore we can associate to the each class of equal eccentricity orbital an unique timelike unit vector, which is called {\\it the observer} of class.",

Studying the mechanics of Poincaré-Snyder relativity is an important means to get to confront the great challenge of constructing the dynamics of Quantum Relativity. The mechanics will also be of interest on its own, plausibly yielding prediction accessible to experiments. We write the straightforward canonical formulation here, and show that it yields sensible physics pictures. Besides the free particle case, we also give an explicit analysis of two particle collision as dictated by the formulation, as well as the case of a particle rebouncing from an insurmountable potential barrier in the time direction. The very interesting solution of particle-antiparticle creation and annihilation as interpreted in a the usual time evolution picture can be obtained, in the simple classical mechanics setting. We consider that a nontrivial success of the theory, giving confidence that the whole background approach is sensible and plausibly on the right track. We also sketch the quantum mechanics formulation, direct from the familiar canoincal quantization, matching to a relativity group geometric quantization formulation in a previous publication.",

      "abstract": "It is commonly believed that the first hyperspace theories in physics were developed in the early twentieth century - Kaluza's five-dimensional extension of relativity is the best known, but this is untrue. It is also commonly believed that W.K. Clifford `speculated' on a higher space in 1870, had no followers and never published his theory (if he even had one). Nothing could be further from the historical truth. As early as 1869, Clifford, his followers and students began to develop a physical theory of matter based on a three-dimensional space curved in four dimensions. Clifford began to publish his theory, but modern researchers have failed to recognize his theoretical work because they look for something like Einstein's theory even though Clifford developed an electromagnetic theory. Clifford may not have directly influenced Einstein's relativity, but he made plausible arguments for the reality of space curvature, rendering the rapid acceptance of Einstein's concept of curved space-time more plausible. Clifford's work is either largely ignored by historians, scientists and other scholars or considered irrelevant because the early work on hyperspaces has been associated with ether theories that were abandoned, utilized quaternion algebras that were replaced by vectors and tensors, and was unfortunately associated with spiritualism. )",

Here, we propose the use of parallax and ranging techniques of distance measurement for Michelson-Morley type experimentation on astronomical scales, elaborating with the earth-moon system. A motivation is the bypass of any hypothetical earth-bound medium as an explanation for the earlier null findings. When the solar system 370 kms-1 motion relative to the cosmic microwave background is taken into consideration, the higher value of receptor velocity and the longer distance sets the stage for a confrontation between Lorentzian and Galileo-Newton dynamical transformations. Two-way ranging time carries along with it information about light's dynamical transformation, thus a comparison of distance measured by ranging with that by parallax, a geometrical method can reveal the correctness of assumptions underlying the dynamical behaviour of light. Two-way ranging times unaffected by the 370 kms-1 velocity indicate null results and further buttress Einstein's relativity theory, while ranging times affected by this velocity indicate non-null results and will manifest as a general increase of ranging distance above actual geometric lunar distance, up to 500 metres in RA 11h 11.649m and 23h 11.649m coordinate directions.",

It is based on a generalized law for spinning and rotational motions, which is in fact the conservation law of momentum vector direction, and can be successfully used for the precision computation of planetary and lunar orbits. The most fundamental principles of the remodeled relativity theory are the conservation laws of energy and momentum. Based on experience of relativity experiments, we adopted the principles that energy level is the underlying cause for relativistic effects, and that mass is expressed by the relativistic energy equation from Einstein. From space age ephemeris generation experience and following nature's way to conserve energy and momentum, we found reason to replace the concept of \"relativity of all frames\" with that of \"nature's preferred frame\", which helped us to escape Einstein's dilemma till 1912, when he concluded that 'there is no way of escape from the consequence of non-Euclidean geometry, if all frames are permissible'. Einstein formulated gtr as a law for all frames, but physicists and astronomers have continued to adopt one or other 'ad-hoc' approach not in full conformity with the basic tenets of gtr/str. Based on above principles, a comprehensive remodeling led to this theory that uses Euclidean space to consistently and successfully simulate numerically the results of all the \"well-established\" tests of gtr (as in our earlier papers), and for the precise calculation of relativistic effects observed in case of the GPS applications, and other tests of str. It combined the essential essence of gtr/str, and the experience of relativity experiments, and has been shown to avoid the inadequacies of the former.",

We have come full circle from the time of Minkowski's 1908 statement to the brink of an imminent new age of discovery. The basis of our understanding of the natural world has evolved in modern times from Newtonian Mechanics to the 2nd regime of Quantum Mechanics; and now to the threshold of a 3rd regime - Unified Field Mechanics (UFM). The Planck scale stochastic quantum realm can no longer be considered the `basement' or fundamental level of reality. As hard as quantum reality was to imagine so is the fact that the quantum domain is a manifold of finite radius; and that the `sacrosanct - indelible' Quantum Uncertainty Principle can now be surmounted. For decades main stream physicists have been stymied by efforts to reconcile General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics. The stumbling block lies with the two theories conflicting views of space and time: For quantum theory, space and time offer a fixed backcloth against which particles move. In Einstein's relativities, space and time are not only inextricably linked, but the resultant spacetime is warped by the matter within it. In our nascent UFM paradigm for arcane reasons the quantum manifold is not the regime of integration with gravity; it is instead integrated with the domain of the unified field where the forces of nature are deemed to unify. We give a simplistic survey of the fundamental premises of UFM and summarize experimental protocols to falsify the model at this stage of the paradigm's development.",

On the basis of an extensive historical reconstruction, the heuristics of Einstein's creation of the general theory of relativity, completing the relativity revolution, is interpreted as a further transformation of the knowledge of classical physics, starting from conceiving gravitation as a borderline problem between field theory and mechanics. The essay thus provides an answer to the puzzle of how Einstein was able to create a theory capable of accounting for a wide range of phenomena that were discovered only much later.",

      "abstract": "The control roots of latency information theory (LIT) are reviewed in this first paper of a three papers series. LIT is the universal guidance theory for efficient system designs that has inherently surfaced from the confluence of five ideas. They are: 1) The source entropy and channel capacity performance bounds of Shannon's mathematical theory of communication; 2) The latency time (LT) certainty of Einstein's relativity theory; 3) The information space (IS) uncertainty of Heisenberg's quantum physics; 4) The black hole Hawking radiation and its Boltzmann thermodynamics entropy S in SI J/K; and 5) The author's 1978 conjecture of a structural-physical LT-certainty/IS-uncertainty duality for stochastic control. LIT is characterized by a four quadrants revolution with two mathematical-intelligence quadrants and two physical-life ones. Each quadrant of LIT is assumed to be physically independent of the others and guides its designs with an entropy if it is IS-uncertain and an ectropy if it is LT-certain. While LIT's physical-life quadrants I and III address the efficient use of life time by physical signal movers and of life space by physical signal retainers, respectively, its mathematical-intelligence quadrants II and IV address the efficient use of intelligence space by mathematical signal sources and of processing time by mathematical signal processors, respectively. The theoretical and practical relevance of LIT has already been demonstrated using real-world adaptive radar, physics and biochemistry applications. It is the objective of this paper to demonstrate that the structural dualities that are exhibited by the four quadrants of LIT are similar to those that were earlier identified by the author for the practical solution of stochastic control problems. More specifically, his 1978 conjecture of a structural-physical LT-certainty/IS-uncertainty duality between bit detection communication and deterministic quantized control problem solutions that led him to the discovery of a Matched Processors practical alternative to Bellman's Dynamic Programming.",

      "abstract": "In Newtonian mechanics, time and space are perceived as absolute entities. In Einstein's relativity theory, time is frame dependent. Time is also affected by gravitational field and as the field varies in space, time also varies throughout space. In the present article, the thermodynamic-based time is investigated. In macroscopic view of thermodynamics, energy is conserved in every system or process. On the other hand, exergy (availability) is not conserved and can be destroyed, and \"irreversibility\" is generated. Since each thermodynamic system may generate different amounts of irreversibility, this quantity is system dependent. The present article investigates the characteristics of entity irreversibility. (1) It is found that the entity behaves in the similar manner as the clock time in the standard configuration of inertial frames under Lorentz transformation. (2) It is also found that the entity is affected by gravity fields in the similar manner as the clock time. We have demonstrated that, like clock time, irreversibility is frame dependent, and affected by gravity in the similar manner as the clock time. For these reasons, we propose to call the irreversibility of the system as the thermodynamic time. The time's arrow is automatically satisfied, since irreversibility generation always proceeds in one direction (toward future). Based on the strength of the findings (1) and (2), a possible application of the irreversibility is an interpretation and management of the aging of biological systems. It is shown by other authors that entropy generation (equivalent to irreversibility) is a parameter for the human life span. Our sensation of time flow may be attributed to the flow of availability and destruction of it through the living system.",

      "abstract": "David Finkelstein was very fond of the new information-theoretic paradigm of physics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. Only recently, however, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation of quantum theory (Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. A 84:012311, 2011; D'Ariano et al., 2017) and of free quantum field theory (D'Ariano and Perinotti, Phys. Rev. A 90:062106, 2014; Bisio et al., Phys. Rev. A 88:032301, 2013; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 354:244, 2015; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 368:177, 2016) from informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical theory, allowing a re-foundation of the whole physics over logically solid grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the holographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the currently observed regime where discreteness is not visible is the so-called \"relativistic regime\" of small wavevectors, which holds for all energies ever tested (and even much larger), where the usual free quantum field theory is perfectly recovered. In the present quantum discrete theory Einstein relativity principle can be restated without using space-time in terms of invariance of the eigenvalue equation of the automaton/walk under change of representations. Distortions of the Poincaré group emerge at the Planck scale, whereas special relativity is perfectly recovered in the relativistic regime. Discreteness, on the other hand, has some plus compared to the continuum theory: 1) it contains it as a special regime; 2) it leads to some additional features with GR flavor: the existence of an upper bound for the particle mass (with physical interpretation as the Planck mass), and a global De Sitter invariance; 3) it provides its own physical standards for space, time, and mass within a purely mathematical adimensional context. The paper ends with the future perspectives of this project, and with an Appendix containing biographic notes about my friendship with David Finkelstein, to whom this paper is dedicated.",

Thus, we may obtain physical results, which contain a Fundamental Parameter (ω<SUB>I</SUB>), depending on the spacetime metrics of the Relativistic Inertial Observers (RIOs) of each specific TPs. This unification give us the capability of modifying objects of one TPs (like NPs) in order to be used in another TPs (like ERT). For example, we begin from the metric-gravitation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and we obtain a new metric-gravitation which is in accordance with ERT. This application to Megacosmos, explains the rotation curves in galaxies and solar systems, eliminating Dark Matter. Besides, the specific value ω<SUB>I</SUB>=±i gives Vossos transformation (VT) endowed with Lorentz metric of complex spacetime and invariant spacetime interval (or equivalently invariant speed of light in vacuum), producing the theory of Euclidean Complex Relativistic Mechanics (ECRMs) which is associated with ERT. Applying the aforementioned theory to Microcosmos, we calculate the position of the fine structure peaks of the atomic hydrogen spectrum. The result is better not only than this extracted using P.

This study investigated helium gas flow through the vent pipe for various configurations, mass flow rates, and pipe diameters. In addition, pertinent properties of both liquid and gaseous helium were investigated. It was observed that helical coiling of the pipe about the Dewar caused less frictional drag and less pressure change than did sharp pipe bending.

Accordingly, a comparison between observational data and theoretical expectations might then be strongly compromised. In the present paper, we give the principles of relativistic localizing systems so as to bypass this issue. Such systems will allow to locate users endowed with receivers and, in addition, to localize any spacetime event. These localizing systems are made up of relativistic auto-locating positioning sub-systems supplemented by an extra satellite. They indicate that spacetime must be supplied everywhere with an unexpected local four dimensional projective structure besides the well-known three dimensional relativistic projective one. As a result, the spacetime manifold can be seen as a generalized Cartan space modeled on a four dimensional real projective space, i.e., a spacetime with both a local four dimensional projective structure and a compatible (pseudo-)Riemannian structure. Localization protocols are presented in details, while possible applications to astrophysics are also considered.",

For in such a medium, supposed isotropic, the light velocity is, essentially, c/ (where is the refractive index, say, for light of a fixed frequency), whereas T<SUB>ix</SUB>, determining the g<SUB>ix</SUB>, contains no trace of, in fact, no properly optical feature of the medium in question.

      "abstract": "The mainstream approach of gravitational field is the development of Geometric theories of gravitation and the application of the Dynamics of General Relativity (GR). Besides, the Generalized Special Relativity (GSR) contains the fundamental parameter (ξ <SUB>I</SUB>) of Theories of Physics (TPs). Thus, it expresses at the same time Newtonian Physics (NPs) for ξ <SUB>I</SUB>→0 and Einstein Relativity Theory (ERT) for ξ <SUB>I</SUB>=1. Moreover, the Equivalence Principle (EP) in the context of GSR, has two possible interpretations: m <SUB>G</SUB> = m (1), or m <SUB>G</SUB>=γ(ξ <SUB>I</SUB>,β)m (2), where β=υ/c and m <SUB>G</SUB>, m, γ are the gravitational mass, inertial rest mass and Lorentz γ-factor, respectively. In this paper we initially present a new central scalar potential V=V <SUB>(k,r)</SUB>, where k=k(ξ <SUB>I</SUB>) and r is the distance from the center of gravity. We demand that ‘this new GSR gravitational field in accordance with EP (1), gives the same precession of Mercury’s orbit as Schwarzschild Metric (SM) does’ and we obtain k=6-ξ <SUB>I</SUB> <SUP>2</SUP>. This emerges Einsteinian SR-horizon at r=5r <SUB>S</SUB>, while NPs extends the horizon at six Schwarzschild radius (6r <SUB>S</SUB>). <P />We can also explain the Gravitational Red Shift (GRS), if only the proposed GSR Gravitational field strength g=g(k,r) is combined with EP (2). We modify the aforementioned central scalar potential as V=V(h,k,r), where h=h(r). The combination of the above with MOND interpolating functions, or distributions of Dark Matter (DM) in galaxies, provides six different functions h=h(r). Thus, we obtain a new GSR central Gravitational field strength g=g(h,k,r), which not only explains the Precession of Mercury’s Perihelion, but also the Rotation Curves in Galaxies, eliminating Dark Matter.",

      "abstract": "Summary. Science tends to advance by small redundant steps. But sometimes it suddenly enjoys a giant leap forward - heliocentric Galileo, Newton and gravity, Lavoisier and atoms, Maxwell and electromagnetism, Einstein's relativity, and so on. Unusually, the giant leap that occurred in the biological sciences in the middle of the last century seems in retrospect to have had a strangely inevitable quality about it. Perhaps that was because physics, which had played such a large part in ending World War II, was being purged by the move of physicists into the innocent pursuit of biology, and they were bringing with them all those useful isotopes plus a happy ignorance of, even distaste for, classical biochemistry and genetics. If Newton had not existed, his analysis of the forces of physics might have been delayed for another century. If Watson, Crick and the X-ray crystallographers of King's College London had not published the structure of DNA when they did, Pauling would surely have worked it out correctly within a few more months (though he probably would have presented it with less bravura).",

      "abstract": "Spacetime has fascinated both specialist and layman for over 100 years. Spacetime geometry is a difficult topic for student understanding despite popularizations such as Albert Einstein's Relativity and Edwin Abbott's Flatland. There are many reasons to create computer-based material for relativity. Special relativity is the first topic presented in modern physics. It is full of (apparent) paradoxes, and, like quantum mechanics, captivates students' interest in physics. Because relativity focuses on abstract concepts, visualization is especially valuable. We report the development of new simulations that allow the exploration of spacetime and the role of the observer. Special relativity examples include: visualizing simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, and spacetime diagrams. General relativity examples include the gravitational red shift, trajectories of particles and light rays, and the observer's view in the vicinity of non-spinning black holes.

And so are George and other characters from the author's previous book Einstein's Enigma or Black Holes in My Bubble Bath. While the present book, Universe Unveiled - The Cosmos in My Bubble Bath, is completely independent, its storyline can be considered a sequel to the previous one. The scientific content spanning ancient world models to the most recent mysteries of cosmology is presented in an entirely nontechnical and descriptive style through the discussions between Alfie, the enlightened learner, and George, professor of astrophysics. Fantasies, based on these discussions that cover the scientific facts, are created by the magical bubble baths taken by Alfie. Universe Unveiled blends accurate science with philosophy, drama, humour, and fantasy to create an exciting cosmic journey that reads like a novel and educates as it entertains. \"Spurred by a series of mind-bending discoveries, Man's millennial love affair with the stars has now reached fever pitch. No one writing today is better positioned to evoke the romance and beauty of these cosmic discoveries than Vishveshwara. A leading expert in Einstein's relativity theory, he brings a lyrical voice and a poetic sensibility to this joyful task.

      "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration has, for the first time, allowed for tests of relativistic gravity in the strong, dynamical and nonlinear regime. Outside Einstein's relativity, spinning black holes may be different from their general relativistic counterparts, and therefore their merger may lead to a modified ringdown spectrum. Last year, we developed a new formalism to derive a modified Teukolsky equation, i.e., a set of linear, decoupled differential equations that describe dynamical perturbations of non-Kerr black holes for the radiative Newman-Penrose scalars Ψ<SUB>0</SUB> and Ψ<SUB>4</SUB>. In this talk, I will focus on: (1) applying our new formalism to slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity; (2) present the master equation in the null tetrad basis; (3) discuss the application of metric reconstruction and perturbation scheme procedures involved in decomposing the master equation to the coordinate basis; (4) and lastly, present the master equations in terms of the radial and angular coordinates. These equations can then be integrated to obtain the QNM spectra. Our work enables the calculation of the QNM spectra, thus laying the foundations to study the gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of black hole coalescence in modified gravity for black holes of any spin. <P />P.W. and N.Y. acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation (Award No. 896696).

      "authors": [
        "Gall, Clarence A."
      ],
      "abstract": "When an electromagnetic radiation (EMR) source is in uniform motion with respect to an observer, a spectral (Doppler) shift in frequency is seen (blue as it approaches, red as it recedes). Since special relativity is limited to coordinate systems in uniform relative motion, this theory should be subject to this condition. On the other hand, the gravitational red shift (Einstein; Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, Crown,(1961), p.129) claims that EMR frequency decreases as the gravitational field, where the source is located, increases. As a gravitational effect, one would expect its derivation from a solution of the general relativistic field equations (R_μσ=0). Up to now, it has only been possible to derive it indirectly, by comparing the gravitational field to a (centrifugal) field produced by coordinate systems in relative rotational motion as an approximation of special relativity. Since rotation implies acceleration, it does not meet the conditions of special relativity so this is unsatisfactory. This work shows that the problem lies in the Schwarzschild metric which is independent of EMR frequency. By contrast it is easy to deduce the gravitational red shift from the frequency dependent Gall metric (Gall in AIP Conference Proceedings 308, The Evolution of X-Ray Binaries,(1993), p. 87).",

      "abstract": "Thus, at all stages of the construction of GR, Mach's ideas were important for Einstein in one way or the other. Einstein did not always explicitly refer to Mach whose influence in these cases reveals itself only in the reconstruction of Einstein's reasoning. Of particular importance for him was the range of Mach's ideas arising out of the latter's relativistic critique of the foundations of Newtonian mechanics and the Machian concept of inertia. Einstein consistently referred to Mach in this respect since 1912. Equally essential for the founder of relativity were Mach's methodological concepts: his adherence to the principle of observability, to the operational approach, and to thought experiment techniques. Machian themes, specifically, Mach's principle, were also instrumental in the genesis of Einstein's relativistic cosmology. Einstein goes on to explain that, in general, Mach's principle may be not fulfilled in GR. But if field equations are modified to include the cosmological λ-term, they yield a solution in the form of a static (spherical or elliptical) closed world, in which Mach's principle is realized. It thus became clear that, drawing on the ideas close to Mach's principle, Einstein built a theory (GR) which does not, in general, involve this principle. Consequently, all the issues raised by Mach's principle have preserved their basic meaning only in the cosmological context.",

I challenge Einstein's relativity and the ad-hoc Lorentz formula by the hypothesis of the dual complex nature of matter. André Lichnerowicz has unsuccessfully presented my hypothesis at the French Academy of Sciences in 1994. Later on, I have extended my treatment by my QUEST/RING Theory, using quaternion algebra to take into account the inner spins (still crucially missing in relativity) of only two basic elementary particles the proton and the electron. I have reformulated gravity as a tiny electric residual force between the protons and electrons. I am modeling the atomic nucleus as a neutronless quarkless, gluonless, cluster of protons surrounded by rings of MeV electrons and the neutron as a compound of proton and electron. This unites the strong, weak, electric and gravitational forces. My nucleus model challenges present mass spectrometric measurements and atomic mass defects.",

      "authors": [

      ],
      "abstract": "In this paper Maxwell equations are used to analyze the propagation of oscillating electric and magnetic fields from a moving electric dipole source. The results show that both the magnetic field and electric fields generated propagate faster than the speed of light in the nearfield and reduce to the speed of light as they propagate into the farfield of the source. In addition, the results show that the speed of the fields are dependant on the velocity of the source in the nearfield and only become independent in the farfield. These effects are shown to be the same whether the source or observation point is moving. Because these effects conflict with the assumptions on which Einstein's theory of special relativity theory is based, relativity theory is reanalyzed. The analysis shows that the relativistic gamma factor is dependant on whether the analysis is performed using nearfield or farfield propagating EM fields. In the nearfield, gamma is approximately one indicating that the coordinate transforms are Galilean in the nearfield. In the farfield the gamma factor reduces to the standard known relativistic formula indicating that they are approximately valid in the farfield. Because time dilation and space contraction depend on whether nearfield or farfield propagating fields are used in their analysis, it is proposed that Einstein relativistic effects are an illusion created by the propagating EM fields used in their measurement. Instead space and time are proposed to not be flexible as indicated by Galilean relativity.",

Based on these, we have a clear picture for the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's), for energies greater than $E &gt; 10^{13}\\, eV$ but less than $E &lt; 10^{26}\\, eV$, in the cosmic medium of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and of the cosmic background neutrinos (CB$\\nu$'s). We find that the CMB plays a pivot role in this energy range, so that the observed \"knee(s)\" and the \"ankle\" could be understood in reasonable terms. What we might observe at the energy near $10^{25}\\,eV$', the so-called \"$W^\\pm$ bursts\" or \"$Z^0$ bursts\", is briefly discussed. Meanwhile, in the early Universe, the CB$\\nu$'s, in view of the tiny neutrino mass, gave rise to the clustering phenomenon, resulting in a neutrino halo attached to each visual ordinary-matter object, such as the Earth, the Sun, and stars - with the $PeV$ neutrinos near the surface of the Fermi-Dirac sphere of the neutrino halo of the Earth playing the most fundamental role.",

      "abstract": "There are three very different approaches to the quantization of gravity. One is to solve the canonically quantized theory nonperturbatively. The other two approaches are to modify Einstein's relativity in some way or to modify our perturbation approach. One possible modification of general relativity is supergravity. This paper will examine the renormalization properties of supergravity coupled to N multiplets of matter. The first part of the paper will discuss how N matter multiplets can be introduced into a supergravity theory in a supersymmetric way. It will then be shown that the theory can be made finite to lowest order in 1/N expansion with the addition of a fourth order gravity term (and its supersymmetric partners). We see then that renormalization considerations of vastly different theories including gravity all lead to the inclusion of fourth order gravitational terms. It is therefore interesting to explore some of the other ramifications fourth order terms have in gravitational theories. The last chapter of this paper discusses the implications of fourth order gravity terms on the stability of singular solutions to the gravitational equations. In particular, it is shown that the Kerr solution, which is a singular solution to Einstein's equations (and hence to the fourth order theory as well since all solutions to the second order theory are also solutions to the fourth order theory) is not a stable solution to the fourth order theory. This suggests that the fourth order theory may have a nonsingular stable solution which is not a solution of the second order theory.",

      "abstract": "The various mathematical models developed in the past to interpret the behavior of natural and manmade materials were based on observations and experiments made at that time. Classical laws (such as Newton's for gravity, Hooke's for elasticity, Navier-Stokes for fluidity, Fick's/Fourier's for diffusion/heat transfer, Coulomb's for electricity, as well as Maxwell's for electromagnetism and Einstein's for relativity) formed the basis of current technology and shaping of our civilization. The discovery of new phenomena with the aid of recently developed experimental probes have led to various modifications of these laws across disciplines and the scale spectrum: from subatomic and elementary particle physics to cosmology and from atomistic and nano/micro to macro/giga scales. The emergence of nanotechnology and the further advancement of space technology are ultimately connected with the design of novel tools for observation and measurements, as well as the development of new methods and approaches for quantification and understanding. The paper first reviews the author's previously developed weakly nonlocal or gradient models for elasticity, diffusion and plasticity within a unifying internal length gradient (ILG) framework. It then proposes a similar extension for fluids and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. Finally, it ventures a gradient modification of Newton's law of gravity and examines its implications to some problems of elementary particle physics, also relevant to cosmology. Along similar lines, it suggests an analogous extension of London's quantum mechanical potential to include both an \"attractive\" and a \"repulsive\" branch. It concludes with some comments on a fractional generalization of the ILG framework.",

      "abstract": "Here, the measurement methods for identifying massive charged particles are investigated. They have been used from early cosmic ray studies up to the present day. Laws such as the classical Lorentz force and Einstein's relativistic kinematics were established before the rise of quantum mechanics. Later, it became crucial to measure the energy loss of charged particles in matter. In 1930, Bethe developed a semi-classical model based on the quantum mechanics of scattering. In the early 1930s, he and others calculated the passage of charged particles through matter including pair creation and bremsstrahlung. Due to missing trust in quantum electrodynamics, however, only semi-empirical methods were employed in order to estimate the mass and charge from the features of particle tracks. In 1932, Anderson inserted a lead plate into the cloud chamber in order to determine the flight direction and charge of the `positive electron'. In the 1940s, nuclear emulsions helped to resolve puzzles about particle identification and quantum electrodynamics. Later, the measurement theory was extended in a cumulative process by adding conservation laws for dynamic properties, probabilistic quantum formulas for resonances, scattering cross sections, etc. The measurement method was taken over from cosmic ray studies to the era of particle accelerators, and finally taken back from there to astroparticle physics. The measurement methods remained the same, but in the transition from particle to astroparticle physics the focus of interest shifted. Indeed, the experimental methods of both fields explore the grounds of `new physics' in complementary ways.",

      "abstract": "A century after Einstein's invention of the photon concept and 80 years after the introduction of entangled states by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and by Schrodinger, entangled photon states have become important in quantum communication and quantum computation schemes. Quantum communication with entangled states is approaching large distances and experiments involving even satellite-bases systems become possible. In some schemes like teleportation and entanglement swapping active feed forward of Bell state measurement results is an essential part of the scheme: together with the intrinsic randomness of the individual measurement result a violation of Einstein relativity is avoided that way. Active feed forward then plays a central role in the completely novel concept of one-way quantum computation as proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel. That concept is qualitatively different from all quantum computer concepts where a sequence of one- and two-qubit quantum gates acts on a suitably chosen input state. In contrast the one-way quantum computer scheme starts with a sufficiently complex and general highly entangled initial state, a cluster state. The specific calculation performed is then defined as a specific sequence of measurements performed on that initial state. An important point is that the specific choice of later measurements is defined by the results of earlier measurements. Using such active feed-forward the one-way quantum computer overcomes the problem of the intrinsic randomness of the individual results in quantum measurement. For photons, the one-way quantum computer can be seen as an extension of the linear optics quantum computation proposal by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn. Recently we realized a one-way quantum computer using four- photon entangled cluster states (P. Walther, K. J. Resch,, T. Rudolph, E. Schenk, H. Weinfurter, V. Vedral, M.Aspelmeyer &amp; A. Zeilinger, submitted to Nature). The state was characterized by full four-qubit tomography. Using various types of cluster states a universal set of 1- and 2-qubit operations was demonstrated. Finally, a Grover search algorithm was implemented.",

      "abstract": "The unification of gravitational and guage fields is a long-standing issue in Physics. It started with the works of, among others, Weyl, Kaluza, Klein, and much later reacquired relevance with the successes of non-abelian gauge theories in the establishment of the electroweak interaction. However, the intersection of General Relativity with gauge theories, in what concerns a common framework to all of them, is still very narrow. In this thesis we assume the validity of Einstein's Relativity for the description of the gravitational phenomena and address the problem of unification of the latter with gauge theories of the Yang-Mills type. For this purpose we have developed a formalism called Matrix Relativity, in which the usual metric tensor and affine connection are provided with internal degrees of freedom. This amounts to considering these objects as matrix-valued fields defined on a four dimensional space-time. Therefore we deal with quantities like (G('(mu)(nu)))(,ij) and ((GAMMA)(,(mu)(nu))('(lamda)))(,ij) with 1 (LESSTHEQ) i, j (LESSTHEQ) N. The dimension N is arbitrary. Having defined and constructed the basic elements of the theory in Chapter II, we first observe that the formalism allows the establishment of a larger group of covariance for the matrix curvature tensor by means of a generalized gauge transformation, that includes general coordinate and N-dimensional unitary transformations as special cases. However, use of this covariance for the construction of invariant lagrangians seems to yield physically unacceptable models. The difficulty associated with the non-abelian nature of the field variables is circumvented in the model discussed in Chapter III, in which use is made of the Einstein ansatz. The model develops precisely the equations of motion for both abelian and non-abelian gauge fields, together with the gravitational field, and may be taken as a unified theory in the sense that the affine connections of the three distinct physical phenomena are derived from an unique quantity, the matrix affine connection. We also study an alternative model in which the matrix affine connection is required to satisfy the quasi -metric condition. The elegance of the model is hindered by the difficulty in completely developing the equations of motion. Nevertheless the results obtained lead us to conclude that abelian and non-abelian gauge theories have much in common with the framework of General Relativity.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of the Röntgen rays and the events connected to it are extraordinary in many respects. Röntgen never disclosed the full details of the experiment which led to the discovery on November 8, 1895. He observed the x-rays by chance. Neither he nor any other scientist had an idea that such radiation might exist. However, it needed a Röntgen to make the discovery, an experimenter of his superior capabilities. His achievement was the culmination point of the development of physics as an experimental science in the 19th Century. This development of physics is described in this report in some detail, together with the institutional structure of university physics in Germany and the status of technical achievements at the time of Röntgen. Röntgen was suspicious, if not disdainful, of theoretical physics which slowly had gained in importance and in institutional representation. Thus, Röntgen's famous discovery, possible only to a mind not prejudiced by theoretical considerations or expectations, happened at a point in the history of physics when predominantly theoretical concepts introduced the paradigm change from \"classical\" to \"modern\" physics: Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, Planck's quantum hypothesis, and Einstein's relativity principle and explanation of the photo-electric effect. The tremendous speed by which the news of the \"new kind of rays\" spread around the world and the sensation this news caused launched an intensity of research on x-rays unprecedented in other areas of research and is reflected in a description of the publication history. The traditional working style of the Institute Director Röntgen, the structure of his Institute, his lack of interest in theory, the burden of his sudden fame and other factors made it practically impossible for him to compete with the rapid development and to contribute substantially to the research on x-rays. Even the award of the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901 did not stimulate him to undertake new research activities. He even succeeded in avoiding presentation of his Nobel Lecture. He took the role of the interested observer, sometimes diverted by priority disputes, mainly with Lenard, or by sensational press reports, and retreated increasingly into final solitude, possibly his answer also to the abundance of honors heaped upon him. The impact of his discovery was, however, enormous. In physics it gave impulses to the discovery of radioactivity, of the identification of the electron, and the development of the model of the atom; and in medicine in its immediate applications in diagnosis and therapy.",

      "abstract": "In this paper strong experimental and observational evidence is advanced for an ever expanding universe through an emerging paradigm shift in physics for the solution of hard problems such as dark-matter. The paradigm shift, in the form of a novel motion-retention theory (MRT), was revealed through a time-complementary duality principle (TCDP) of physics, first surfacing in optimum stochastic control in 1960. MRT transforms time-reversible motion theories solved with certainty initial state vectors, like Newton's laws and Einstein's relativity, into time-irreversible motion theories since uncertainty initial state vectors are now assumed. This, in turn, gives rise to the solution of motion problems by considering two time-complementary windows of time for their solution. One of the windows deals with the past, where uncertainty state vectors are retained and the other deals with the future where certainty state vectors are derived through motion theories that depart from estimates of uncertainty initial state vectors. In the future window of time, the motion of a discovered quantum of mass in gyration, named gyrador, occurs that is the average mass of a medium's dissimilar cells, such as human cells or the monatomic atoms of the Sun as demonstrated in E. H. Feria (234 Meeting of AAS). On the other hand, the past window of time will address the retention of thermal-energy that is stored in the medium's uncertainty microstates whose disorder is measured by the medium's entropy. A discovered quantum of thermal energy, named thermote, denoting the quantum of thermal-energy due to the degrees of freedom of the medium, will fuel the kinetic energy of the gyrador, where the orbiting speed of the gyrador is found by equating the total kinetic energy of the gyradors to the gravitational potential energy of the medium. In this way a gravitational quantum expression emerges, named the gyrador mass equation (GME), found to reject dark-matter, and thus offering strong evidence for an ever expanding universe where dark-energy is unopposed (D. Overbye, NYT, Jan. 14, 2020). Another strong evidence for an ever expanding universe is the indication that its number of thermotes, equal to the universe's fixed mass-energy over the thermote's thermal-energy, increases with entropy as shown for black-holes and photon-gases in E.H. Feria (230 Meeting of AAS). This number of thermotes increase, in turn, reveals that a likely energy source for the universe's expansion is the thermote's thermal energy lost as the universe's entropy increases with time.",

      "abstract": "In this third of a multi-paper series the discovery of a space dual for the laws of motion is reported and named the laws of retention. This space-time duality in physics is found to inherently surface from a latency-information theory (LIT) that is treated in the first two papers of this multi-paper series. A motion-coder and a retention-coder are fundamental elements of a LIT's recognition-communication system. While a LIT's motion-coder addresses motion-time issues of knowledge motion, a LIT's retention-coder addresses retention-space issues of knowledge retention. For the design of a motion-coder, such as a modulation-antenna system, the laws of motion in physics are used while for the design of a retention-coder, such as a write/read memory, the newly advanced laws of retention can be used. Furthermore, while the laws of motion reflect a configuration of space certainty, the laws of retention reflect a passing of time uncertainty. Since the retention duals of motion concepts are too many to cover in a single publication, the discussion will be centered on the retention duals for Newton's Principia and the gravitational law, Coulomb's electrical law, Maxwell's equations, Einstein's relativity theory, quantum mechanics, and the uncertainty principle. Furthermore the retention duals will be illustrated with an uncharged and non-rotating black hole (UNBH). A UNBH is the retention dual of a vacuum since the UNBH and vacuum offer, from a theoretical perspective, the least resistance to knowledge retention and motion, respectively. Using this space-time duality insight it will be shown that the speed of light in a vacuum of c <SUB>M</SUB>=2.9979 x 10 <SUP>8</SUP> meters/sec has a retention dual, herein called the pace of dark in a UNBH of c <SUB>R</SUB>=6.1123 x 10 <SUP>63</SUP> secs/m <SUP>3</SUP> where 'pace' refers to the expected retention-time per retention-space for the 'dark' knowledge residing in a black hole.",

      "abstract": "We that show two body gravitational orbits may be plotted using a radial reference frame rather than the customary Newtonian rectilinear inertial frame. Infinitesimal calculus cofounder and continental contemporary of Newton, Leibniz claimed that the second radial derivative could be found by taking the difference between an inertial force varying inversely, with the cubed radius and the gravitational force varying with an inversed squared radius. His radial method was severely criticised by Newton and supporters, who preferred the rectilinear inertial frame, also claiming Leibniz failed to satisfy Newton's third law of gravity. We show that these two approaches are equivalent if the central body is much larger than that in orbit. Furthermore we justify the Leibniz least action approach using the semi-latus rectum of the orbit, characteristic of the eccentricity to calculate the Newtonian centripetal acceleration opposed by the inertial acceleration, with the net radial acceleration controlling radius also allowing estimation of angular displacement and the action for each interval. Numerically, our Leibniz model can be more accurate since it requires no assumption that linear vectors adequately simulate a curvilinear trajectory. Our review of the Newton gravitational equation using centre of mass coordinates concludes that the third law is satisfied for symmetry if the gravitational and inertial masses are taken separately as equating force expressions for gravity and radial inertia, directed to the centre of mass for radial inertia. This symmetry validates centre of mass radial coordinates for more accurate plotting of orbits including dual stars, possibly applicable for better understanding of Einstein relativity. An advantage of radial coordinates is that orbiting couples can also accept perturbations from other nearby bodies acting centripetally, but not inertially.",

      "authors": [
        "Gisin, Nicolas"
      ],
      "abstract": "Experimental violations of Bell inequalities using space-like separated measurements precludes the explanation of quantum correlations through causal influences propagating at subluminal speed. Yet, ``everything looks as if the two parties somehow communicate behind the scene.'' We investigate the assumption that they do so at a speed faster than light, though finite. Such an assumption doesn't respect the spirit of Einstein relativity. However, it is not crystal clear that such ``communication behind the scene'' would contradict relativity. Indeed, one could imagine that this communication remains for ever hidden to humans, i.e. that it could not be controlled by humans, only Nature exploits it to produce correlations that can't be explained by usual common causes. To define faster than light hidden communication requires a universal privileged reference frame in which this faster than light speed is defined. Again, such a universal privileged frame is not in the spirit of relativity, but it is also clearly not in contradiction: for example the reference frame in which the cosmic microwave background radiation is isotropic defines such a privileged frame. Hence, a priori, a hidden communication explanation is not more surprising than nonlocality. We prove that for any finite speed, such models predict correlations that can be exploited for faster-than-light communication. This superluminal communication doesn't require access to any hidden physical quantities, but only the manipulation of measurement devices at the level of our present-day description of quantum experiments. Consequently, all possible explanations of quantum correlations that satisfy the principle of continuity, which states that everything propagates gradually and continuously through space and time, or in other words, all combination of local common causes and direct causes that reproduce quantum correlations, lead to faster than light communication. Accordingly, either there is superluminal communication or the conclusion that Nature is nonlocal (i.e. discontinuous) is unavoidable [Nature Physics DOI: 10.1038/NPHYS2460 (2012); arXiv:1210.7308].",

      "abstract": "Knowledge unaided power centroid (KUPC) adaptive radar and its latency information theory (LIT) roots are reviewed in this third paper of a three paper series. LIT is the universal guidance theory for efficient system designs that has inherently surfaced from the confluence of five ideas. They are: 1) The source entropy and channel capacity performance bounds of Shannon's mathematical theory of communication; 2) The latency time (LT) certainty of Einstein's relativity theory; 3) The information space (IS) uncertainty of Heisenberg's quantum physics; 4) The black hole Hawking radiation and its Boltzmann thermodynamics entropy S in SI J/K; and 5) The author's 1978 conjecture of a structural-physical LT-certainty/IS-uncertainty duality for stochastic control. LIT is characterized by a four quadrants revolution. While the first and third quadrants are concerned with the life time of physical signal movers and the life space of physical signal retainers, respectively, the second and fourth quadrants are about the intelligence space of mathematical signal sources and the processing time of mathematical signal processors, respectively. The four quadrants of LIT are assumed to be physically independent with their system design methodologies guided by dualities and performance bounds. Moreover, all the LIT quadrants are bridged by statistical physics, inclusive of a recently discovered time dual for thermodynamics that has been named lingerdynamics. The theoretical and practical relevance of LIT has already been demonstrated using real-world control, physics, biochemistry and the KUPC adaptive radar application that is reviewed in this paper. KUPC adaptive radar is a technique that falls within the fourth quadrant of LIT, and is thus a mathematical signal processing technique whose goal is the efficient detection of moving targets in real-world taxing environments. As is highlighted in this review KUPC adaptive radar is found to come relatively close to the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) radar performance of DARPA's knowledge-aided sensory signal processing expert reasoning (KASSPER) even though it is knowledge unaided.",

Our science is derived from the three recent NRC Decadal Surveys in astrophysics, heliophysics, and planetary science. Four research themes were developed that are uniquely facilitated by human exploration: Heliophysics and Space Radiation, Lunar Laser Ranging, Low Radio Frequency Astrophysics and Cosmology, and Exploration Science. In this talk, we describe some of the fundamental problems which our team is investigating including the acceleration of high energy particles in the heliosphere that are potentially harmful for humans and spacecraft beyond low Earth orbit, the nature of gravity beyond Einstein's Relativity and the cores of airless bodies using laser ranging, and the origins of the first stars and galaxies in the Universe using low frequency radio telescopes on the radio-quiet lunar farside. In addressing these issues, we are developing technologies that are likely to have a dual purpose, serving both exploration and science. Our team has proposed compelling science for a 'waypoint' mission involving human telerobotics at the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point. Astronauts aboard the Orion Crew Vehicle will operate lunar farside surface assets for the first time which also serves as an important proving ground for future exploration missions in deep space. The science objectives include returning rock samples from the ancient South Pole-Aitken basin and deployment of a low frequency radio telescope for cosmological observations of the early Universe's Cosmic Dawn. We will describe the first recently-completed simulation of a human waypoint mission where astronauts aboard the International Space Station interactively controlled a high fidelity planetary rover at an outdoor analog testbed at NASA/Ames to deploy a prototype radio antenna. LUNAR is funded by the NASA Lunar Science Institute to investigate concepts for astrophysical observatories on the Moon. Part of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the present paper is to clarify, as far as it is possible, the overall picture of experimental results in the field of non-conventional phenomena in nuclear matter published in the scientific literature, accumulated in the past few decades and still missing a widely accepted interpretation. Completeness of the collection of the experiments is not among the aims of the effort; the focus is on adopting a more comprehensive and integral approach through the analysis of the different experimental layouts and different results, searching for common features and analogous factual outcomes in order to obtain a consistent reading of many experimental evidences that appear, so far, to lack a classification in a logic catalogue, which might be compared to a building rather than a collection of single stones. Particular attention is put on the issue of reproducibility of experiments and on the reasons why such a limitation is a frequent characteristic of many experimental activities reported in published papers. This approach is innovative as compared with those already available in the scientific literature. In a synoptical table, a comprehensive classification is given of the twenty experiments examined in terms of types of evidences that are ascertained by the experimenters in their published papers but are \"unexpected\" according to well-established physical theories. Examples of such unexpected evidences (named also non-conventional or weird) evidences are: excess heat generation, isotope production, reduction of radioactivity levels, and production of neutrons or alpha particles. These evidences are classified taking into account both the material where the evidence takes place (solutions, metals, rocks and artificial materials) and the stimulation techniques (supply of electric voltage, irradiation by photons, mechanical pressure) used to generate the evidences (which do not appear in the absence of such stimuli at an appropriate intensity). Also, in our paper, \"identity cards\" are provided for each experiment examined, including details that emerged during the experiment and were reported in each respective paper, that sometimes are not given adequate consideration either by the author of the experiment or in other review papers. The analysis of the details provides suggestions (also referred to as clues in this papers) used to formulate the content of the second part of each identity card, where inferences deduced from facts are outlined in view of presenting tentative interpretation at the microscopic level. This is done by concentrating attention on the clues repeated in different experiments in order to yield possible explanations of the \"unexpected\" evidences. The main outcome of such analysis is that, in all examined cases, a common \"operation\" can be identified: the stimulation techniques mentioned above can be interpreted as a sort of compression producing a ramp of energy densification (with reference to volumes in space or time coordinates). Here we use the term \"compression\" to indicate an operation activated by the experimenter; as such, it is objective. We consider energy densification an inference of possible consequences of the operation on the status of the system. Five types of densifications were identified. This reading in terms of energy densification is in accordance with the predictions of the Deformed Space Time theory, reported in the scientific literature, in the context of a generalization of the Einstein relativity theory, according to which the existence of energy thresholds is found to separate, for each interaction, the flat metric part from the deformed metric part and the appearance of new microscopic effects as a consequence of trespassing such thresholds. The phenomena occurring in the deformed part of the interaction metric are governed by the energy density in the space-time (volume and time interval). This energy density is computed from the threshold energies and is peculiar to the phenomenology under consideration. As a conclusion, it is suggested that the revealed qualified information, homogenized and elaborated on, might help in repeating, with proper adjustments and adequate additional instrumentation, some key experiments, in order to ensure systematic reproducibility, which is a prerequisite for interpretations and explanations to be sound and credible, as well in deriving from such an effort, indications for new experiments. It is uncomfortable that, after thirty years, there are still pending questions to which the most acknowledged physical theories are not capable of giving an answer. Even a definitive demonstration that all these experiments have decisive faults would be preferable than leaving the issue unaddressed. Major research agencies, for instance in the USA and in Europe, are moving in this direction.",

      "abstract": "For more than thirty years the search for gravitationnal waves, predicted by Einstein's relativistic theory of gravitation, has been an intense research field in experimental as well as theoretical physics. Today, with the constant advance of technology in optics, lasers, data analysis and processing, ... a promising way of directly detecting gravitationnal waves with earth-based instruments is optical interferometry. Before the end of this century many experiments will be carried on in Australia, Europe, Japan and the United States to detect the passage of a gravitationnal wave through giant Michelson-type interferometers. The effects predicted are so small, (a gravitationnal wave changes the length of three kilometer long arms by one thousandth of a fermi) that the need for “perfect” optical components is a key to the success of these experiments. Still a few years ago it would have been impossible to make optical components that would satisfy the required specifications for such interferometric detectors. For nearly ten years constant R&amp;D efforts in optical coating manufacturing, optical material fabrication and optical metrology, allow us today to make such components. This text is intended to describe the field of optical metrology as it is needed for the testing of optical parts having performances far beyond than everything previously made. The first chapter is an introduction to gravitationnal waves, their sources and their effects on detectors. Starting by newtonian mechanics we jump rapidly to the general theory of relativity and describe particular solutions of Einstein's equations in the case of weak gravitationnal fields, which are periodic perturbations of the space-time metric in the form of plane waves, the so-called gravitationnal waves. We present various candidate sources, terrestrial and extra-terrestrial and give a short description of the two families of detectors: resonnant bars and optical interferometers. The second part of this chapter is a description of the various optical components that have to be manufactured and tested for Virgo. The next sections are dedicated to the description of various metrology instruments. In chapter 2 we focus on absorption of light in multilayer coatings. The sensitivity of interferometric detectors is degraded by this loss process, not only because it decreases the laser beam power, but also and chiefly because thermo-elastic deformations and changes of the indexes of refraction modify the beam profile. Optical coatings have now reached an absorption level lower than at m. We present a method based on the mirage effect, i.e. the deflexion of light by an index of refraction gradient induced by non homogeneous heating. This “mirage bench” has a sensitivity better than 10^{-8}. We start by a discussion of the approximations that are useful to simplify the problem, we then derive the equation that give the signal amplitude versus the absorption factor. Afterwards we describe the instrument and give a few results with home made Virgo mirrors as well as commercial samples. In the following chapter we discuss the problem of measuring reflexion factors. We focus on two particular problems, the first one is common, it is to measure high (higher than 0.9999) reflexion factors by the use of Fabry-Perot cavities. We present various possible schemes and we detail a particular one which seems to be the easiest to implement. We use a pulsed laser source and measure the average reflexion factor of the two Fabry-Perot mirrors by studying the pulse shape modification after transmission by the cavity. We estimate the sensitivity of this intrument to 10^{-6}. The second problem is a less common one and is to evaluate the relative homogeneity of reflexion factors on large components. Because inhomogeneities of this parameter will degrade the sensitivity of Virgo by coupling various modes of the laser beam with the fundamental one, homogeneity higher than 1{-}10^{-4} is required. We propose a simple scheme and describe a bench built following this scheme. This bench, being a first try, is far from being optimized and the measurement method could be used with other experimental realizations. By using various geometries measurements can be performed on high reflectivity mirrors as well as on beamsplitters with a comparable sensitivity of 10^{-4}. At last we discuss the problem of surface figure testing. Virgo needs are for optical surfaces with defects smaller than ten nanometers peak to valley on twelve centimeter diameter surfaces. These surfaces can not be tested by classical ways, Fizeau interferometers are sensitive enough but do not have a sufficient precision because of the obligatory presence of a reference surface to compare the samples with. We present a method based on local slope measurement that permits to reach the required precision, to the detriment of measurement time. <P />",

This fact comes from the similarity effect of physical events those obey always to a 2nd order partial differential equation, PDE at specific boundary conditions, SBCs. The coefficients in the operator part and the source function part of the PDE and propagation factors of the eigenfunctions in the solution and SBCs differ from an event cathegory to other event cathegory; however stochastic interpretations of these coefficients, source functions, eigenfunctions, and SBCs bring a unique and compact boundary value problem, BVP. We call network BVP this type of extended BVPs. The common parts of different types of events A and B in the same BVP scheme are topology and boundary surfaces of the same domain. The relationship between event A and event B is based on inversely transferring of boundary values, source functions, and coefficients between each other of the events through topological transformations, TTs. These TTs establish the bidirectional information communication between both climatic and seismic processes. All the natural events and hazards involving disasters are the self-control mechanism of the Completely Compact Earth Network, CCEN. The sea is a way and transfer medium for waves by Pascal's rule.The constrainers of Present Natural Hazards, PrNHs, are the Future Natural Hazards, FuNHs.

The approaches built on Einstein's relativity can not generate RPs for the interwall of over 6.9 Richter; i.e., a temporal transportation occurs in the last domain: Kocaeli-Mediterranean Sea EQ in 1999 is a result of both backward majorant propagation effect, BMaPE of Hector Mine EQ occured after itself and forward majorant propagation effect, FoMaPE of the seismicity to Future İstanbul Earthquake, sFIEQ.

The constrainers of 2019 Silivri, Albania, and Athens EQs are the FIEQ desired in demand for future but never come. 1999 Avcilar EQ is a result of backward minorized propagation effect, BMiPE of the sFIEQ. This means the waiting/relaxation period of FIEQ is suspended. These are figured from the specific records of these events observed during 1999-2004 and 2018-2020. The couplings among ionospheric, atmospheric, oceanographic, climatic, and/or seismic processes provide the communication among the events of different cathegories in here. We define this principle as the spati-o-temporal transplantation effect in EQ processes.The SIDT is the most safe region on the Earth for the majorant earthquakes and preserves this property iff unconvenient/unnatural buildings and major excavations are excluded from this topology.",

        "Feria, Erlan H."
      ],
      "abstract": "Statistical physics bridges for latency information theory (LIT) are revealed in this second paper of a three paper series that include the discovery of the time dual of thermodynamics. LIT is the universal guidance theory for efficient system designs that has inherently surfaced from the confluence of five ideas. They are: 1) The source entropy and channel capacity performance bounds of Shannon's mathematical theory of communication; 2) The latency time (LT) certainty of Einstein's relativity theory; 3) The information space (IS) uncertainty of Heisenberg's quantum physics; 4) The black hole Hawking radiation and its Boltzmann thermodynamics entropy S in SI J/K; and 5) The author's 1978 conjecture of a structural-physical LT-certainty/IS-uncertainty duality for stochastic control. LIT is characterized by a four quadrants revolution with two mathematical-intelligence quadrants and two physical-life ones. Each quadrant of LIT is assumed to be physically independent of the others and guides its designs with an entropy if it is IS-uncertain and an ectropy if it is LT-certain. While LIT's physical-life quadrants I and III address the efficient use of life time by physical signal movers and of life space by physical signal retainers, respectively, its mathematicalintelligence quadrants II and IV address the efficient use of intelligence space by mathematical signal sources and of processing time by mathematical signal processors, respectively. Seven results are stated next that relate to the revelation of statistical physics bridges for LIT. They are: 1) Thermodynamics, a special case of statistical physics, has a time dual named lingerdynamics; 2) Lingerdynamics has a dimensionless lingerdynamics-ectropy Z that is the LT-certainty dual of a dimensionless thermodynamics-entropy, and like thermodynamics has four physical laws that drive the Universe; 3) S advances a bridge between quadrant II's source-entropy H in bit units and quadrant III's retainer-entropy N in SI m2 units; 4) Z advances a bridge between quadrant I's mover-ectropy A in SI secs and quadrant IV's processor-ectropy K in binary operator (bor) units; 5) Statistical physics bridges are discovered between the LIT entropies and the LIT ectropies; 6) Half of the statistical physics bridges between the LIT entropies and LIT ectropies are found to be medium independent, thus yielding the same entropy-ectropy relationships for black holes, ideal gases, biological systems, etc.; and 7) A medium independent quadratic relationship τ=l(M/▵M)2 relates the lifespan τ of a retained mass M to the ratio of M to the fractional mass ▵M that escapes it every l seconds, e.g., for a human with M = 70 kg, expected lifespan of τ=83.9 years (or 2.65 Gsec), l=1 day (or 86.4 ksec), its daily escaping mass is given by ▵M=0.4 kg. In turn, this requires him/her to consume 2,000 kcal per day (i.e., 5,000 kcal/kg times 0.4 kg) to replace the 0.4 kg lost from day to day which correlates well with expectations.",

      "abstract": "Merging Einstein's relativity with quantum mechanics leads almost inexorably to relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). Although relativity and non-relativistic quantum mechanics have been on solid mathematical footing for nearly a century, many aspects of relativistic QFT remain elusive and poorly understood. In this thesis, we study two fundamentally important objects in quantum field theory: the S-matrix of a given QFT, which quantifies how quantum states interact and scatter off of each other, and the partition function, a quantity which defines observables of a given QFT. In chapters 2--6, we study generic properties of the S-matrix between on-shell massless states in four- and six-dimensions. S-matrix analysis performed with on-shell probes differ from more conventional analysis, with Feynman diagrams, in two important ways: (1) on-shell calculations are automatically gauge-invariant from start to finish, and (2) on-shell probes are inherently delocalized through all of space and time, i.e. they are \"long distance'' probes. In chapter 2, we note that one-loop scattering amplitudes have ultraviolet divergences that dictate how coupling constants in QFT \"run'' and evolve at finite distance. We show that on-shell techniques, which use exclusively long distance probes, are nevertheless sensitive to these important finite distance effects. In chapters 3--4, we show how the manifestly gauge-invariant on-shell S-matrix can be sensitive to what are called \"gauge anomalies'' in more conventional discussions of relativistic quantum systems, i.e. in local formulations of quantum field theory. In chapter 5 we use the basic tools of the analytic S-matrix program in an exhaustive study of the simplest non-trivial scattering processes in massless theories in four-dimensions. From the most basic incarnations of locality and unitarity, we derive many classic results, such as the Weinberg--Witten theorem, the equivalence theorem, supersymmetry, and the exclusion of \"higher spin'' S-matrices. Finally, in chapter 6, we inductively prove that the entire tree-level S-matrix of Einstein gravity in four dimensions can be recursively constructed through on-shell means. This implies, as a corollary, that the Einstein-Hilbert action may be completely excised from studies of tree-level/semi-classical scattering in General Relativity. In chapters 7--9, we note a surprising property of statistical mechanical partition functions for many exactly solved quantum field theories, and explore a basic corollary. In chapter 7, we note that many partition functions, Z(T) = sumn e-En/T, that can be exactly computed and re-summed into closed-form expressions, are surprisingly self-similar under temperature reflection (T-reflection). In short, we find that Z(+ T) = eigamma Z(-T), where gamma is a real number that is independent of temperature. This T-reflection symmetry only exists for a unique value of the ground state energy, often given by the naive quantization of classical potentials/Hamiltonians. In chapter 8, we note that a certain limit of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is symmetric under T-reflections only when its vacuum energy vanishes. We verify that this is indeed the correct vacuum energy of this theory through two calculations that are independent of each other and independent of the presence or absence of T-reflection symmetry. In chapter 9, we use this T-reflection symmetry to obtain a detailed understanding of the presence/absence of Hagedorn phase transitions in a certain calculable limit of QCD.",

      "title": "Black Holes Have Simple Feeding Habits",
      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "The biggest black holes may feed just like the smallest ones, according to data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ground-based telescopes. This discovery supports the implication of Einstein's relativity theory that black holes of all sizes have similar properties, and will be useful for predicting the properties of a conjectured new class of black holes. <P />The conclusion comes from a large observing campaign of the spiral galaxy M81, which is about 12 million light years from Earth. In the center of M81 is a black hole that is about 70 million times more massive than the Sun, and generates energy and radiation as it pulls gas in the central region of the galaxy inwards at high speed. <P />In contrast, so-called stellar mass black holes, which have about 10 times more mass than the Sun, have a different source of food. These smaller black holes acquire new material by pulling gas from an orbiting companion star. Because the bigger and smaller black holes are found in different environments with different sources of material to feed from, a question has remained about whether they feed in the same way. <P />Using these new observations and a detailed theoretical model, a research team compared the properties of M81's black hole with those of stellar mass black holes. The results show that either big or little, black holes indeed appear to eat similarly to each other, and produce a similar distribution of X-rays, optical and radio light. AnimationMulti-wavelength Images of M81 <P />One of the implications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity is that black holes are simple objects and only their masses and spins determine their effect on space-time. The latest research indicates that this simplicity manifests itself in spite of complicated environmental effects. <P />\"This confirms that the feeding patterns for black holes of different sizes can be very similar,\" said Sera Markoff of the Astronomical Institute, University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, who led the study. \"We thought this was the case, but up until now we haven't been able to nail it.\" People Who Read This Also Read... NASA’s Swift Satellite Catches First Supernova in The Act of Exploding Jet Power and Black Hole Assortment Revealed in New Chandra Image Chandra Data Reveal Rapidly Whirling Black Holes Ghostly Glow Reveals a Hidden Class of Long-Wavelength Radio Emitters <P />The model that Markoff and her colleagues used to study the black holes includes a faint disk of material spinning around the black hole. This structure would mainly produce X-rays and optical light. A region of hot gas around the black hole would be seen largely in ultraviolet and X-ray light. A large contribution to both the radio and X-ray light comes from jets generated by the black hole. Multi-wavelength data is needed to disentangle these overlapping sources of light. <P />\"When we look at the data, it turns out that our model works just as well for the giant black hole in M81 as it does for the smaller guys,\" said Michael Nowak, a coauthor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"Everything around this huge black hole looks just the same except it's almost 10 million times bigger.\" <P />Among actively feeding black holes the one in M81 is one of the dimmest, presumably because it is \"underfed\". It is, however, one of the brightest as seen from Earth because of its relative proximity, allowing high quality observations to be made. <P />\"It seems like the underfed black holes are the simplest in practice, perhaps because we can see closer to the black hole,\" said Andrew Young of the University of Bristol in England. \"They don't seem to care too much where they get their food from.\" <P />This work should be useful for predicting the properties of a third, unconfirmed class called intermediate mass black holes, with masses lying between those of stellar and supermassive black holes. Some possible members of this class have been identified, but the evidence is controversial, so specific predictions for the properties of these black holes should be very helpful. <P />In addition to Chandra, three radio arrays (the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array), two millimeter telescopes (the Plateau de Bure Interferometer and the Submillimeter Array), and Lick Observatory in the optical were used to monitor M81. These observations were made simultaneously to ensure that brightness variations because of changes in feeding rates did not confuse the results. Chandra is the only X-ray satellite able to isolate the faint X-rays of the black hole from the emission of the rest of the galaxy. <P />This result confirms less detailed earlier work by Andrea Merloni from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany and colleagues that suggested that the basic properties of larger black holes are similar to the smaller ones. Their study, however, was not based on simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations nor the application of a detailed physical model. <P />These results will appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

On the one hand, this is an excellent introduction for mathematicians to the differential geometry underlying general relativity. On the other hand, this is definitely a book for mathematicians. <P />The book's greatest strength is its clear, precise presentation of the basic ideas in differential geometry, combined with equally clear and precise applications to theoretical physics, notably general relativity. But the book's precision is also its greatest weakness; this is not an easy book to read for non-mathematicians, who may not appreciate the notational complexity, some of which is nonstandard. <P />The present edition is very similar to the original, published in 1992. In addition to minor revisions and clarifications of the material, there is now a brief introduction to fibre bundles, and a (very) brief discussion of the gauge theory description of fundamental particles. The index to the symbols used is also a more complete than in the past, but without the descriptive material present in the previous edition. <P />The bulk of the book consists of a careful introduction to tensors and their properties. Tensors are introduced first as linear maps on vector spaces, and only later generalized to tensor fields on manifolds. The differentiation and integration of differential forms is discussed in detail, including Stokes' theorem, Lie differentiation and Hodge duality, and connections, curvature and torsion. To this point, Wasserman's text can be viewed as an expanded version of Bishop and Goldberg's classic text [1], one major difference being Wasserman's inclusion of the pseudo-Riemannian case from the beginning (in particular, when discussing Hodge duality). Whether one prefers Wasserman's approach to Bishop and Goldberg's is largely a matter of taste: Wasserman's treatment is both more complete and more precise, making it easier to check calculations in detail, but occasionally more difficult to remember what one is calculating. An instructor using this text would be well advised to think carefully about which topics to cover, rather than trying to do everything. <P />The remainder of the book contains applications to mechanics, relativity and gauge theory. In each case, better treatments exist elsewhere. However, each such treatment typically introduces its own notation; it is not without some truth that differential geometry is often described as the study of objects under changes of notation. Having several short treatments of these different topics in one place makes it easy for the instructor to choose those he or she wishes to emphasize, while providing a clear transition to more advanced treatments. <P />The presentation does have some idiosyncrasies. The key concept of a derivation is not clearly defined. Some subtleties are referred to in cryptic comments ('This space is too large') which are never explained. The occasionally nonstandard notation is not always easy to follow, although this is a common criticism of introductory texts in differential geometry, which must balance precision with understanding. And appropriate cross references are not always given in sentences of the form 'Recall that ...', which on occasion contained (correct) results which I did not find obvious, and which I could not quickly find explicitly stated in earlier sections. I also have one minor gripe about the publishing format, namely that the outside margins are too small, at only 1 cm; I found this extremely distracting. But all of these criticisms are minor. <P />Wasserman's book would unquestionably be an excellent introduction to tensor analysis for mathematicians, especially those who are interested in the physics applications. The readers of Classical and Quantum Gravity will want to know whether the book is equally suitable as a text for an introductory course in general relativity. At first glance, this text appears to fill a niche in mathematical sophistication between, say, the undergraduate texts by Schutz [2] or d'Inverno [3], which do not require prior background in differential geometry, and the graduate text by Sachs [4], which does. Nonetheless, the answer, unfortunately, is no. <P />I teach a course in general relativity primarily aimed at advanced undergraduate mathematics majors, which is, however, taken by both undergraduate and graduate students in both mathematics and physics; it is the only course in general relativity taught at my university. Each time I teach the course, I struggle to choose an appropriate text. Wasserman's book has frequently been one of the finalists, but I have never quite been willing to inflict it on my physics students, choosing instead to list it as an optional text. (I have been equally unwilling to inflict Hartle's marvellous book [5] on my mathematics students.) <P />My main objection to this book as a relativity text is not, however, due to concern that the mathematical sophistication is too much for undergraduate physics students. Rather, as a mathematical text in relativity, it does not go far enough. The standard applications are here, but just barely. There is a good discussion of the Schwarzschild solution, including applications to solar system tests and its interpretation as a black hole. However, the Kerr solution is barely mentioned, and the Reissner-Nordström solution is conspicuously absent. Similarly, the cosmological implications of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions are discussed only briefly. And that's it - no further cosmology, no mention of gravitational waves, etc. Fair enough for a mathematics text in tensor analysis, but not enough to permit this book to be used as a standalone relativity text. This is, ultimately, why I have never used this book as a primary text: I want to spend more time doing relativity and less time proving theorems. <P />For a course for mathematicians (only), however, or as a supplementary text filling in some of the missing mathematical details, this book would be an excellent choice. <P />References <P />[1] Bishop R L and Goldberg S I 1980 Tensor Analysis on Manifolds (New York: Dover) <P />[2] Schutz B F 1985 A First Course in General Relativity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) <P />[3] d'Inverno R 1991 Introducing Einstein's Relativity (Oxford: Oxford University Press) <P />[4] Sachs R K 1977 General Relativity for Mathematicians (New York: Springer) <P />[5] Hartle J B 2003 Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity (San Francisco: Addison Wesley)",

      "title": "World-Wide Effort Produces Dramatic \"Movie\" of Cosmic Jet",
      "authors": [],
      "abstract": "Astronomers using a world-wide collection of radio telescopes, including the National Science Foundation's Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), have made a dramatic \"movie\" of a voracious, superdense neutron star repeatedly spitting out subatomic particles at nearly the speed of light into two narrow jets as it pulls material from a companion star. The movie shows these jets ejecting clouds of hot plasma that are then \"zapped\" by pulses of energy in the jets as they move away from the neutron star. Frame from Radio-Telescope 'Movie' of Scorpius X-1 <P />\"We have directly measured the speed of energy flow in a cosmic jet for the first time,\" said Ed Fomalont, an astronomer at the NRAO in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fomalont worked with Barry Geldzahler and Charles Bradshaw of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. The astronomers used the VLBA, the NSF's Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank 140-foot telescope, along with radio telescopes from the European VLBI Network, Australia, Japan and South Africa to record the double-star system's eruptions continuously for 56 hours. <P />\"This study is going to be extremely valuable in helping us understand a phenomenon that we see throughout the universe,\" Fomalont said. Cosmic jets of superfast particles are ejected from the cores of numerous galaxies. On a smaller scale, similar jets are ejected from binary-star systems closer to home, in our own Milky Way Galaxy. While the jets from galaxy cores are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes millions of times more massive than the Sun, the closer \"microquasars\" are powered by much smaller black holes or by neutron stars only a few times more massive than the sun. <P />\"Studying one of the closer, smaller examples will help us understand how they all work, including the bigger ones,\" Geldzahler said. \"The jets coming from distant galaxies are harder to study because of their much greater distance and the slowness of their evolution. The changes we saw in an hour take thousands of years in the distant galaxies,\" he added. <P />The astronomers observed Scorpius X-1, a system consisting of a neutron star roughly 1.5 times the mass of the sun and a \"normal\" star about the same mass as the sun. The two, more than 9,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius, orbit each other every 18 hours and 53 minutes. Scientific instruments aboard a brief rocket flight over New Mexico in 1962 revealed that X-rays are coming from the system, and the pair of stars has been observed extensively since then. <P />For the latest study, whose results are published in the May 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters, Fomalont, Geldzahler and Bradshaw used telescopes around the world to make highly-detailed radio images of the ejections. As the object went below the horizon for one set of radio telescopes, it was rising for the next set, allowing continuous imaging for the 56-hour period. The Very Long Baseline Array <P />In the U.S., the astronomers used the VLBA, a network of 10 radio telescopes spread across U.S. territory from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands. They also used the European VLBI Network, including telescopes in the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands, plus a telescope in South Africa and one at the NRAO in Green Bank, WV. In addition, they used the Asia-Pacific Telescope Array which included five telescopes in Australia, plus telescopes in China, Japan and South Africa. <P />\"To keep watching this thing as the Earth turned, we had to use most of the major radio telescopes in the world, and the necessary coordination took months to organize,\" Fomalont said. <P />At the same time, two optical observatories, Braeside Observatory and the Steward Observatory 90-inch telescope on Kitt Peak, and the orbiting Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observed the object. \"These observations tell us what is happening near the neutron star and the accretion disk\" said Bradshaw. \"All of the energy in the jet and the radio source is produced from this small region.\" <P />The individual radio telescopes were combined into larger \"virtual telescopes\" capable of producing extremely detailed images. The \"movie\" of Scorpius X-1 consists of images showing detail roughly equivalent to being able to read a newspaper in Los Angeles from the distance of New York. <P />Cosmic jets, most astronomers believe, arise when a massive object, such as a neutron star or a black hole, draws in material. Instead of being sucked directly into the massive object, the material first forms a whirling \"accretion disk\" that closely orbits the central object. Friction within the accretion disk can heat it to temperatures so hot that it radiates X-rays. Excess energy also is vented by ejecting subatomic particles from the poles of the disk at speeds nearly that of light. <P />\"These things are tremendous particle accelerators, propelling huge amounts of matter at fantastic speeds. Unfortunately, we don't understand the physics of how they work very well at all. That's why we're so excited to have this 'movie' of extremely detailed images to help us figure out what is really going on in this system,\" Geldzahler said. \"Ed and I have been studying Scorpius X-1 for nearly 20 years and we finally got the resources to probe deeply into its evolution.\" <P />During the 56 hours in June of 1999 when the astronomers were observing, Scorpius X-1 cooperated by being very active. The object's core, near the orbiting pair of stars, showed changes in the brightness of its radio emission. In addition, \"lobes\" of bright radio emission were pushed outward by the jets at about half the speed of light. These lobes, the scientists think, are produced when the fast moving particles in the jet, created from the accretion disk, collide with the surrounding interstellar material caught in the flow. Near the beginning of the movie, one moving set of lobes disappeared, but new lobes were ejected from the core a few hours later and proceeded outward. <P />The movie also shows Einstein's relativity in action. Although two clouds are pushed by the jets in opposite directions away from the core, the cloud moving toward the Earth appears to be 15 times brighter and moving two times as fast as the cloud moving away from us. \"We believe that both clouds are similar and the difference that we see is just a relativistic illusion caused by their fast motions,\" said Fomalont. <P />Twice, the core flared in brightness as it shot a burst of electrons outward at more than 95 percent of light speed. As this burst reached the lobes, the collision of the fast electrons with the lobe material caused the lobes to brighten. The exquisite detail and continuous formation of the radio images allowed the scientists to directly measure the speed of the fast electrons in the beam, marking the first time ever that the speed of energy flow in such a cosmic jet has been measured. <P />\"Scorpius X-1 put on a great show for us. Now it's up to us to figure out how it performs its act,\" said Fomalont. <P />The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.",
