      "abstract": "In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.",

      "abstract": "The writers investigate the possibility of an atomistic theory of matter and electricity which, while excluding singularities of the field, makes use of no other variables than the g<SUB>μν</SUB> of the general relativity theory and the ϕ<SUB>μ</SUB> of the Maxwell theory. By the consideration of a simple example they are led to modify slightly the gravitational equations which then admit regular solutions for the static spherically symmetric case. These solutions involve the mathematical representation of physical space by a space of two identical sheets, a particle being represented by a \"bridge\" connecting these sheets. One is able to understand why no neutral particles of negative mass are to be found. The combined system of gravitational and electromagnetic equations are treated similarly and lead to a similar interpretation. The most natural elementary charged particle is found to be one of zero mass. The many-particle system is expected to be represented by a regular solution of the field equations corresponding to a space of two identical sheets joined by many bridges. In this case, because of the absence of singularities, the field equations determine both the field and the motion of the particles. The many-particle problem, which would decide the value of the theory, has not yet been treated.",

      "abstract": "The indirect interaction between adatom pairs on the (100) surface of a simple-cubic tight-binding solid is investigated within a molecular-orbital approach. A general scheme for calculating the surface-density-of-states change and the interaction energy of one and two single-level adatoms is presented, and contact (and a correction) is made with Grimley's formulation. The method permits binding above surface atoms, at bridge sites, or at centered positions, and yields interaction energy as a function of band filling, adatom energy level, and a general hopping potential V between an adatom and the nearest surface atom(s). Calculations have been carried out for VW<SUB>b</SUB> in the range 1/12-1/2, the upper limit giving split-off states (W<SUB>b</SUB>≡bandwidth). The single-atom interaction shows little dependence on binding type, in all three cases being most attractive when the Fermi energy equals the noninteracting adatom level, with a strongly V-dependent strength. For the pair interaction, one finds a strength at nearest-neighbor separation of about an order of magnitude smaller than the absorption energy of a single adatom. This interaction has an exponentiallike dropoff and sign alternations as one moves along the &lt;10&gt; direction. Under reasonable conditions, the nearest-neighbor interaction is often repulsive while the next nearest, third nearest, or fourth nearest is attractive, suggesting the patterns c(2×2), (2 × 2), and c(4×2), respectively, which are frequently observed in the adsorption of simple gases on the (100) surfaces of transition metals. On the basis of two-dimensional Ising-model calculations including second-neighbor interactions, one can estimate the strength of V from the observed disordering temperature of the adatom lattice; the result is similar to that obtained from estimates based on the heat of adsorption.",
