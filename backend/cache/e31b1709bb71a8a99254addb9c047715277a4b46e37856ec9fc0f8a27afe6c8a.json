The families provide a unique view of catastrophic disruption phenomena and have been in the focus of planetary scientists for more than a century. Most of them are located in the main belt, a ring of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. Here we review the basic properties of the families, discuss some recent advances, and anticipate future challenges. This review pays more attention to dynamic aspects such as family identification, age determination, and long-term evolution. The text, however, goes beyond that. Especially, we cover the details of young families that see the major advances in the last years, and we anticipate it will develop even faster in the future. We also discuss the relevance of asteroid families for water-ice content in the asteroid belt and our current knowledge on links between families and main-belt comets. query Please check the edit made in the article title.",

      "authors": [
        "Robert J Ng",

      ],
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, EDITOR: We thank Dr Pearce for his letter. One goal with our article was to increase awareness and initiate a balanced discussion. We acknowledge the work required to attain a doctorate. We are not suggesting that optometrists mislead the public into thinking that they hold a doctorate or are medical doctors, but are merely stating that the courtesy title may change the way the public perceives optometry. As originally stated, the current perception of optometrists is that we are retail oriented. Anecdotally, some may not be aware that optometrists have been able to treat most eye conditions since 2005. Furthermore, optometrists in both Australia and New Zealand, regardless of their degree level, are equally well trained to manage eye conditions, better than the average general practitioner. All optometrists are experts in the field and to say otherwise is suggesting that those that do not hold a higher qualification are just glorified refractionists. If the use of ‘Dr’ title does not make a difference to public perception, then why are individuals in New Zealand with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery or Bachelor of Veterinary Science, calling themselves ‘Dr’? Most do not hold a doctorate. As per our original Viewpoint, there is currently legal precedence by other health professions in New Zealand in using it to inform the public of their capabilities following guidelines from their respective regulatory authority, so why not optometrists? Dr Pearce also seems to disregard the medical aspect of optometry and discussed the low therapeutic prescribing rates in Australia. There now appears to be a gap between optometrists in Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand, the therapeutics scope has progressed to include the use of oral medications, independent glaucoma management, and COVID vaccinations. In 2019, one in 25 therapeutic optometric prescriptions was for an oral medication and the mean number of oral prescriptions per optometrist in that year was 12.4. There was also a recent consultation by the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians Board (ODOB), to include a scope for ophthalmic laser procedures. Fortunately, there is foresight by ODOB in seeing the profession evolve (while protecting safety of patients). Finally, we are aware that this optional change will not be adopted by all. In fact, dentists in the United Kingdom recently celebrated their 25 anniversary in adopting the Doctor title. Pike recalls that there was originally reluctance in adopting the title by older dentists, compared to younger practitioners. The same can be seen here. Those who graduated with their optometry degree pretherapeutics would have spent approximately half their career refracting and screening rather than managing pathology, whereas those who graduated with their degree after the introduction of the therapeutics scope see themselves as less traditional optics-focussed clinicians but more medically focussed. Such a topic has always been controversial. But there is a professional responsibility by optometrists to not only to provide the best care to their patients but also to protect and evolve our profession. We are guardians for the next generation.",

      "abstract": "A significant opportunity for synergy between pure research and asteroid resource research exists. We provide an overview of the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization, and highlight where we can accelerate the closing of knowledge gaps, leading to the utilization of asteroid resources for growing economic productivity in space. Mine Project Value Curve Project Value as a function of mineral resource confidence, and associated terrestrial industry terms. Executive Summary The study of asteroids as a way to understand Solar System origins and dynamic evolution is accelerating with recent science missions including OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa 2 and soon to be launched missions including Psyche, Lucy, DART, MMX and Janus. Simultaneously there has been a rapid growth of activity around ​using the vast resources of the asteroids. Many of the science mission results also contribute to understanding these objects as potential orebodies. A significant opportunity for synergy between pure research and asteroid resource research has opened up, with pure and applied research each benefiting from the other. This white paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization, and highlights where further research can help accelerate the closing of science knowledge gaps, leading to the utilization of asteroid resources for growing economic productivity in space. Asteroid Resources Asteroid Resources are vast. The iron in the Main Belt has some 10 million times the known resources on Earth . Water and other volatiles, as well as precious metals, are also abundant 1 among the asteroids. For a long time, though, the prospect of actually harnessing these resources has seemed remote. Now “Mining the Sky” is no longer seen as a fantasy, but as a realistic, though challenging, enterprise. Starting about a decade ago, there have been a number of well-publicized start-ups with asteroid mining as their goal: Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, TransAstra and others. These commercial pursuits have been supplemented by a space-resource focused degree program at the Colorado School of Mines, and graduate seminars at the University of Central Florida, among others. The near-term hurdles are mostly financial. Development of the necessary technology needs too long a horizon (>5 years) for most investors. The US government has often brought down risk for entrepreneurs by investing in new technology . NASA is already supporting asteroid 2 resource activities via the SBIR and NIAC programs . Keeping in mind that NASA is charged to 3 “​seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space” , 4 and its strategic goal #3: “Address national challenges and catalyze economic growth” , support 5 of asteroid mining perfectly fits NASA’s mandate. More directly, Planetary Science will directly benefit from asteroid resource utilization. The same technologies developed for asteroid resource use will also bring great benefits to planetary science by enabling many more deep 1 “Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets”, John S.

      "abstract": "On November 25, 2015, the President of the United States (US) signed into law the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. This event received extensive coverage, both in the press and legal literature, mostly due to the content of its Title IV dedicated to Space Resource Exploration and Utilization. Pursuant to Title IV, US citizens shall be entitled under US law to collect, own, transport and sell asteroid and space resources that they have obtained in the course of resource recovery operations. Considering that international space law does not clarify whether space resources can be appropriated and used for commercial purposes, the enactment of the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act has been deemed by some commentators to amount to a breach of the international obligations of the US. In light of this controversy, the purpose of the present paper is to assess the consistency of the Act with international space law and to discuss the legal and political implications related to its adoption and (future) implementation.",
