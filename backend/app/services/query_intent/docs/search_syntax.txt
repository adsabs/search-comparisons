ADS Search Syntax Documentation

1. Search Basics
---------------
ADS supports both fielded and unfielded queries. Unfielded queries search metadata including author, publication year, title, abstract, identifiers, and bibstem.

2. Fielded Searches
------------------
- author:"Lastname, F" - Search for papers by author
- author:"^Lastname, F" - Limit to first-author papers
- abs:"term" - Search in abstract, title, and keywords
- title:"term" - Search in title only
- abstract:"term" - Search in abstract only
- keyword:"term" - Search in keywords
- year:YYYY - Search for specific year
- year:YYYY-YYYY - Search for year range
- body:"term" - Search in article body
- full:"term" - Search in title, abstract, body, acknowledgements, and keywords
- bibstem:ApJ - Search in specific publication
- object:((SMC OR LMC) AND M31) - Search using SIMBAD and NED object search

3. Boolean Operators and Grouping
--------------------------------
- AND - Both terms must match (default)
- OR - Either term can match
- NOT - Exclude term
- -term - Exclude term (same as NOT)
- (term1 OR term2) AND term3 - Group terms with parentheses

Operator precedence:
1. NOT
2. AND
3. OR
4. Default AND (space between terms)

4. Wildcards and Proximity
-------------------------
